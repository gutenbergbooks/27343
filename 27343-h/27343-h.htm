<p>FOREWORD</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Given a Camp-fire, a group of friendly girls and a
good story-teller who knows and loves the girls, and
the ideals of a whole community may be lifted in a
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The teen age girl is a great problem and at the
same time a great opportunity. Her ideals seem
low, yet there is no time in her life when she will
more gladly follow a great ideal. She seems fickle,
yet she is putting her friends to a test that is most
worth while. She is misunderstood and she can not
understand herself. She is searching for something,
yet she does not know what it is.</p>
<p>Her problems are many, and most of them she
must solve alone. If she follows the crowd and
goes in the way of least resistance, there is a big
chance that she will fall by the way. If she does
not follow the crowd, it is because somewhere, some
time, she has found a compelling ideal and is following
it. Sometimes that ideal comes to her in the
form of a friend. Sometimes she is fortunate enough
to have found that ideal in her mother. But often
and often it comes to her through a little story that
lives with her, and works for her, and helps her to
hold to the best, in spite of the manifold temptations
to do otherwise.</p>
<p>Recently I met a young woman whom I had seen
only once and that was twelve years ago. She came
to me after a service and said, &#8220;Will you tell Van
Dyke&#8217;s &#8216;Lump of Clay&#8217; to-night? Twelve years
ago I heard you tell it. I was so discouraged at
the time, for everything seemed going wrong and
life seemed so useless. But I dropped into a church
and heard you tell the story. You have no idea
what it has done for me. I am teaching in the college
near by and I should like to have my girls hear
the story. Perhaps they need it as I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the workers with girls have seen this
need and have wanted to meet it and yet have been
unable to find the story that was needed by the girl.
It is because of this very need in my own work that
I am sending out these stories, most of which I have
told over and over to my girls. Many of them have
been written because of special problems that needed
to be met&mdash;problems peculiar to adolescence&mdash;problems
found in every class and club of girls the country
over.</p>
<p>The stories are not to amuse, for we have no time
to amuse girls in the story hour. We have little
enough time, at the best, for implanting ideals and
every story hour should leave a vital message. That
is the thing the girls want and why should we give
them less.</p>
<p>The stories are not to be read. They need the
personal touch, the sympathetic voice, the freedom
of eye that tells the story-teller which girls are finding
the message of the story. Some of them will
hurt&mdash;but experience has shown me that these are
the very ones that one has to tell over and over.
Can you imagine the Master reading to the groups
gathered about him the stories that you and I love
to read in his word? When you go into the heart
life of a girl, let all your personality help you to
carry the message. It was the Master&#8217;s way of
story-telling.</p>

<h2>I WOULD BE TRUE</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8217;Twas a beautiful day in the late fall and the roadside
was lined with the late asters and goldenrod.
The sun was shining so brightly and the sky was as
blue as a New Hampshire sky could be, yet the girl,
walking along the winding, climbing road, saw none
of them. The little brook by the roadside whispered
and chattered as it ran along, yet she did not hear; a
few late birds still twittered to her from the trees, but
she did not notice; a chipmunk called to her from a dead
tree by the roadside, but she paid not the least attention.
She was alone with her thoughts and they were
far from pleasant.</p>
<p>How different it all seemed from what it had seemed
six months before! Then she had stood in the office
of a great doctor in Philadelphia and heard him say to
her father, &#8220;Unless you leave the city at once and go
where there is pure air and simple food and real quiet,
there is no help for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The father had looked at the doctor for a moment in
silence and then answered, &#8220;Well, if that is the case,
I am sorry, for I cannot leave the city. My business
needs me; Katherine is in college and she must be here.
I shall stay.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>But with flashing eyes the girl had stepped to the
doctor and said, &#8220;Father is mistaken, doctor. His business
can do without him and there is no need at all why
he should stay here for me. There is a dear little old
place in the hills of New Hampshire that belongs to us,
where grandfather used to live. We can go there and
have all the things that you have said he must have.
You may leave the matter with me. We shall be out
of the city within two weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then turning to her father she had put her arms
about his neck and said, &#8220;Of course we can go, daddy,
for what is college and money and friends compared
with your health? Gladly will I give them up for you.
We shall have a wonderful time there in the hills&mdash;just
you and mother and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they had come. Then it was early in the spring
and the country was beginning to show green. Into the
little old farmhouse under the hill they moved. Of
course there were no electric lights, and no telephones,
and no faucets out of which the water could be drawn.
But there were the quaint old candle holders on the big
mantels; there was the fireplace so large that a log
could be drawn into it; there was a well in the yard
with water as cold as ice. And outside the home&mdash;oh,
there were the most wonderful things to see. The trailing
arbutus trailed everywhere; the lady slippers grew
even in the front dooryard. The old trees in the yard
were soon filled with nesting birds; the apple and pear
trees in bloom were a sight never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>So the days fled by and the little family under the
hill were so happy to see the color coming back to the
face of the sick one and the smile once more on his face.
Katherine loved it all&mdash;the home&mdash;the flowers&mdash;the
mountains and even the quiet of the little hamlet.</p>
<p>Then the summer had come and with it the stream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
of visitors who come every year to the New Hampshire
mountains. Within a short distance of the home were
large hotels, and the guests soon learned of the cool
water in the well in front of the house; of the father
who was such a pleasant companion; of the pretty girl
who could sing, and climb, and play so well. So there
had been picnics, and parties, and auto rides, and the
summer had fled.</p>
<p>And when the people had gone, there were the wonderful
colors in the trees, the gorgeous sunsets in the
sky, the fun of the harvest time and still the life in the
country was full of wonder and satisfaction.</p>
<p>But now&mdash;oh, now the days had begun to grow cold,
the trees were bare, the birds had flown to the south,
and her friends had all gone away. Here and there
a family was left in the farmhouses that dotted the
little, winding road but none of them were people for
whom she cared. And so as the days had come and
gone, there had crept into the heart of the girl a loneliness
that would not be forced down, a longing that she
could not stifle, a dissatisfaction that grew with the
days.</p>
<p>How could she pass the long winter nights that were
ahead? How could she stay away from the friends who
were gathering at the college? How could she live
without her piano? How could she keep a smile so that
the dear ones at home would not see how unhappy she
was becoming? The house seemed so big and bare; the
trees in the yard seemed to sigh instead of sing; the way
ahead seemed full of blackness. She longed for all that
had gone; she longed for her friends, especially the one
who had been her ideal during her college days; she
longed to run back to him for always.</p>
<p>But on this October morning, she had risen early to
keep the quiet hour before the rest were up. Usually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
she read in the gospels, but this morning her Bible
opened to the Psalms and she read, &#8220;I will lift up mine
eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help. My
help cometh from the Lord who made heaven and earth.&#8221;
She stopped and looked from the window at Mt. Kearsarge
in the distance.</p>
<p>Then she read again, &#8220;I will lift up mine eyes unto the
hills from whence cometh my help.&#8221; &#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the girl,
&#8220;I need help. God knows I need help. I wonder if
there is any help for me. &#8216;I will lift up mine eyes unto
the hills from whence cometh my help.&#8217; Perhaps if I
should go out into the hills for the day, God would help
me. I think I will try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the mother she had said, &#8220;I think I should like to
go for a long walk to-day if you do not mind. I feel
like having a tramp,&#8221; and then with lunch box in hand
and book under her arm, she had started.</p>
<p>As long as father and mother could see, she had smiled
and waved to them, but when the turn in the road had
come, the light faded from her eyes and her problem
was still before her. The night before had been endless,
yet there were longer ones to come. No wonder she
saw no sunshine, heard no bird and saw no brook as she
walked along the country road.</p>
<p>On and on she went; mile after mile was put behind
her, till the sun was high in the heaven and she was
weary and hungry. Then a sudden turn in the road
brought her to the foot of a little lake&mdash;one of those
mountain lakes that make New Hampshire so beautiful.
All around it were hills; the water was very, very blue and
its surface was as calm as could be. A moss-covered stone
was very near and the girl sank beside it and, leaning
her head on her hand, she looked at the quiet waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;how I wish my life were
as calm as the lake. One would never dream that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
ever were rough and troubled. I wish God could send
peace to me as He sends it to the little lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes wandered to the shores and then to the
hills about the lake. How beautiful the tall pines and
spruces were! How fragrant the resinous balsams!
How bleak and cold the trees with no leaves!</p>
<p>Then her eyes turned to the top of the hills when
suddenly&mdash;it seemed as if by magic&mdash;there stood out
before her, as if outlined in the sky, the giant face of a
man. What could it be? Had it been carved there?
How strong and noble the face seemed to be! How had
it come to be there at the very top of the hill? Then
she remembered a story she had heard when first she
had come to the valley. This must be the &#8220;Old Man of
the Mountain.&#8221; For centuries and centuries he had
stood here guarding the little lake.</p>
<p>When the wonder of finding the Great Stone Face had
passed by, she studied it. The forehead was high and
the face of noble mien. The mouth showed much of
strength. It was a face one would like to see often.
God had put it there&mdash;the God who made the heaven
and earth. Then there came to her mind again the verse
of the morning, &#8220;I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills
from whence cometh my help.&#8221; Perhaps the Old Man
of the Mountain could help her. He had stood here for
years and years. He must know what it meant to be
weary with the long days and the longer nights. He
must have seen the multitude pass by and still leave him
in the mountains. Perhaps he would understand how
lonely and full of unrest she was.</p>
<p>So leaning her head on the moss-covered stone, she
said dreamily, &#8220;Old Man of the Mountains, if you were
I and were longing to go back to your work and your
friends, if you were afraid of the long winter that is
coming, if you had a duty to do right here when you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
longed to be there, if you had a father who needed you
and a mother who is brave as can be, and still there
burned within you the longing to get back to the others,
what would you do? Are you never weary with it all?
Do you never long to run away from your task that God
has given you to do? Are you never discontented?
Oh, Old Man of the Mountain, if you were I and had
my burden to carry, what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>A silence was everywhere as she listened for his answer.
Not a bird sang, not a ripple crossed the lake.
For a moment she watched the face&mdash;then another, and
then she was sure that she saw the face begin to relax.
A sign of a twinkle came across the great stone eyes
and the lips smiled as there came to her heart this
answer:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, little girl from the city with a burden to carry!
What would I do if I had a father who was surely growing
strong and a mother who had smiled through the
days of the sickness? What would I do if I longed to
go back to the life of pleasure and happiness when my
duty lay here? What would I do if I had forgotten the
books that might be read during the long winter nights
for which there had been no time in the city; the lessons
of patience and loyalty that might be learned in doing
the hard thing; the happiness of really being needed?
What would I do if I were you and were lonely and
discouraged and heartsick?</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Aye, little girl from the city, I would go back into the
little home under the hill with all its comfort, and home-likeness,
and wealth of love, and I would look up to God
for help; I would laugh at the hard things and help them
to vanish from sight; I would love the dear ones who
are dearer to you than life itself; and I would lift, not
only their burden, but that of others who need you in
this beautiful valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly the face was again set into the lines that others
saw and the head of the girl dropped deeper into the
moss. For a long time there was no sign that she had
heard. Then she lifted a face, full of light, to that of
the Old Man of the Mountain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, my friend,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have lifted my
eyes unto the hills and help has come. I will go back
to the little white house and, with God&#8217;s help, I will look
up, and I will laugh, and I will love, and I will lift.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she ate her lunch by the calm, little mountain lake
and the tiny breezes whispered in her ears. Then she
walked again the winding road that led down to the home.
But the sky was blue and full of beauty; the birds heard
an answering call; the little brook gave her to drink,
and the chipmunk found on his stump a little piece of
the cake from the box. Her face was smiling and her
heart full of courage, for she had looked unto the hills&mdash;and
God had answered.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
<h2>THE APPEAL TO THE GREAT SPIRIT</h2>
</div>

<p>Owaissa, the Indian Squaw, sat before the tepee
watching little Litahni play with the colored stones.
The child was the idol of the tribe, for was not her father
the great chief Black Hawk who had done so much for
his people? So, lest anything should happen to the little
one, Owaissa made it her chief task to be where the child
was and to teach her the things she wanted her to know.</p>
<p>Three years before, the good missionary who was
leaving the encampment had said to Owaissa, &#8220;Soon there
will come to your tepee a little child. Should it be a
little girl, teach her to see herself in the things about her,
so that the birds, and the trees, and the flowers, and the
winds may all help her to grow true and fine, even as
they help the young braves to grow brave and strong.
The girls of your Indian tribes are not given half a
chance to see the helpers all about them. Teach her to
see, as I have taught you to see, what a woman can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the words of the missionary had burned into the
very soul of Owaissa. Her child should have a chance.
So when the little girl had come to her wigwam, she had
named her Litahni&mdash;a little light&mdash;and she had sought
for ways to help her to see what nature meant that man
should see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Catch a little raindrop,&#8221; she said to the little girl
as she played near the wigwam. &#8220;Every raindrop helps
some plant, even though it is so little. You are tiny,
too, but you can help every day just as the raindrop
does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See the beautiful sunset,&#8221; she said to the older girl,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
as they tramped home from gathering the wood for the
fire. &#8220;The colors are creeping all over the sky. We
see the sunset here and we are happy because it is so
beautiful, but away over the mountains in the far away
the sunset is just as beautiful and they are happy there as
they see it. You can bring happiness, too, both here and
far away, if your life is beautiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to the wind in the trees,&#8221; she said to the girl
of fourteen who was eager to do that which father wanted
her to leave undone. &#8220;You cannot see the wind, yet it
sways the great trees and sometimes fells them. You
can bend the will of the strong men of the tribe but you
cannot do it by talk and by ugly words. Learn to bend
by gentleness and quietly. Learn to steal into their lives
as the wind steals through the trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the girl was sixteen, the young men of the tribe
were beginning to love her and to want to take her to
their wigwams. Then the mother knew she must show
her how to choose. So she sought for ways to help her
as they hunted the mountains for the wild berries. Often
they sat by the lakeside for their midday meal. Sometimes
it was rough and sometimes calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, daughter,&#8221; said Owaissa. &#8220;The little lake is
very rough to-day. Sometimes our lives are like the
little lake. Not always are they calm. Storms sweep
over the life. But take the lesson from the lake. Be
beautiful through it all. Down beneath the surface, the
water is calm and untroubled even though the white caps
are above.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once they were caught in the mountains in a terrific
storm. Litahni crept close to the mother when the thunder
rolled loud and long, but she loved to see the long
streaks of lightning flash across the sky.</p>
<p>Then Owaissa said, &#8220;The thunder cannot hurt you,
dear. Seldom does that which comes with a big noise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
do the harm, for one can run from it and be safe. Fear
that which comes silently and swiftly and which strikes
at the heart. The lightning yonder is far from us but
it may strike at the heart of a giant pine and fell it to
the ground. That which should have stood long and
sturdy is then rendered useless and laid low.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the coming of the winter the good squaw died
and there were evil days ahead for the Black Hawk tribe.
They were having quarrels with the white men, and the
chief was very busy. So Litahni was left much alone
and the days were long and lonely. Now she was glad
for all that her mother had taught her, for the birds, and
the flowers, and the trees, and the animals all helped her
to pass the days and they spoke to her of the things that
her mother had taught her. She tried hard to help her
father, and often she knew that she had helped him, but
she longed to do more.</p>
<p>&#8220;No squaw has ever done it, but I believe I can. I
shall teach my people to love the white man&#8217;s God, for
then we should not have wars and quarrels,&#8221; said the
girl.</p>
<p>So she taught the little children; she told stories to
the squaws and she won the confidence of the young
men of the tribe who would soon be in the council fires.
And all the tribe loved Litahni, the beautiful daughter
of Black Hawk and Owaissa.</p>
<p>One day, across the plain, there came a white man.
He was tall and dark and sturdy-looking. He had education
and he could talk well. Litahni saw much of
him for a few days and she came to honor the white
man as she listened to him drive the bargains for the
furs and the blankets and the baskets.</p>
<p>Now, as the white man watched the little Indian
teacher, he saw how far above the tribe she was. He
loved her pretty face, her sweet way and her gentle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
spirit. Then the white man wanted to win the Indian
girl. In the far East, he had left a girl who loved him
but he wanted the Indian girl,&mdash;so he began silently to
make love to her. Of course he knew that her father
would never consent. He knew that he would be driven
from the encampment if ever they found what he was
doing, so hastily and quietly he worked to win her.</p>
<p>He told her of the wonderful land from which he
had come; of the beautiful houses in which his friends
lived; of the lives of ease which they lived; then he told
her of his love for her and begged her to flee with him
to his land and his people. To Litahni, it was all so
wonderful that she listened happily. How she would
love to see it all! If she went there, she could see again
the missionary of whom the mother had told her so
often.</p>
<p>And when he had finished, she told him of her dreams&mdash;how
she wanted to help the tribe to learn to love the
great God, and to make the tribe of Black Hawk the
finest tribe in all the land around.</p>
<p>But when she, too, had finished, he loved her all the
more for her beautiful wish, so he held her closely to
him and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Litahni, to love and to be loved is a far greater
happiness than to lift, or to bend, or to lead the tribe.
Leave that to your father. All these things you can do
to me and to my people. Would you waste your life
here on the plains? Think what I can give you. Your
mother longed to go beyond the mountains into the
sunrise. Come with me and I will take you there. To
love and to be loved is the best that ever comes into a
life. And I love you, Litahni! Why should you think
of your father? He has many things to think of and
has little time for you. I will make you my queen.
To-morrow I must go. So to-night, I shall come for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
my answer after the sun has set. Meet me, dear, by the
giant tree near the spring and we will go together. The
train leaves not long after the sunset and I will have a
horse at the spring on which we can get to the train.
Come with me, dear. Forget your people and be my
Litahni.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a noise near by&mdash;and the white man was
gone. But Litahni sat deep in thought. While he had
been with her, she longed to go with him. But as she
sat now and looked down into the valley at the encampment,
she was not so sure. Her mind was all awhirl.
Was this the way to happiness? What would mother have
said? She wanted her to have the best, but what was
the best? It was only a few hours till the sunset and
what should she do? Was there no one to help her?</p>
<p>Suddenly from the roadway below she heard a
neigh. It was Fleetfoot, and he was tired of being tied
to a sapling. Now Litahni loved Fleetfoot, her horse,
for they had grown up together, so she hurried to the tree
where she had left him, untied his bridle, jumped on his
back and whispered,</p>
<p>&#8220;Fly, Fleetfoot! Fly into the sunset. Go fast and
go far and let me think as we fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the horse sped away toward the north. As they
passed the little lake in the valley it whispered, &#8220;Life
is not always calm. There must be tempests. But
you can be calm in your inner life and you can be beautiful
through it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up the hill she went, and as the wind blew over her
face it seemed to say, &#8220;Why be bent? Why not bend?&#8221;
At the top, looking far across a distant plain, her
mother&#8217;s voice seemed to whisper, &#8220;Look far ahead, little
girl. Look far ahead. What seems wonderful may
prove to be only a shadow.&#8221;</p>
<p>On they flew. The girl&#8217;s face was flushed and thoughtful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
Soon she must turn if she would be at the meeting
place. Where was Fleetfoot taking her? Perhaps he
knew best what she should do.</p>
<p>Suddenly at a bend in the road Fleetfoot gave a great
leap, startling the girl and almost making her lose her
balance. Across the path, a giant tree had been felled
by the lightning and there it lay, prone and helpless.</p>
<p>Then she shuddered. &#8220;Fear that which comes quickly
and silently and which strikes at the heart.&#8221; Only a
week before she had not known the white man&mdash;even
now her father did not know that she knew him. Ought
she to be afraid? If she met him, it must be silently, in
the cover of the dark.</p>
<p>At last Fleetfoot stood, panting and breathless, on the
great rock that topped the cliff. Often had he come here
with his mistress, so he waited for her to dismount. The
sky was aflame with color&mdash;all red and gold and yellow.
Far to the North there were blues and pinks. What a
wonderful sunset it was! Surely it must be the home
of a great, great God.</p>
<p>Litahni sat motionless for a time, drinking in all the
glory of the scene. Then she threw her arms high over
her head and, lifting her face into the sunset, she cried,</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thou Great Spirit to whom my people have always
prayed, though they knew thee not as the great
God; oh thou to whom my mother taught me to pray,
show me the way to happiness. I would my life should
be as my mother wished it to be&mdash;a little light. I would
do my best in the right place. Is love for the white man
the way to happiness? Is it the way in which I should
go? Answer as by fire. I beg of thee. Answer me as
by fire, oh, thou great God of the Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Motionless the horse and his rider stood as the moments
passed by, one, two, three. The red of the sunset
enfolded them and God was very near.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>Suddenly far to the south there rose a tiny black cloud.
Very tiny it was, yet it grew and it grew. It blotted out
the red and then the yellow and then the gold, and then
the whole sky was dark and the wind blew chill.</p>
<p>Slowly Litahni&#8217;s arms relaxed and her head fell to the
mane of the horse. When she lifted it, her face looked
tired and worn, but over it there was a look of peace.
Patting the mane of the horse, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for bringing me here, Fleetfoot. The
Great Spirit has answered and I shall stay here with
Father and with you. To love selfishly is to blot out all
the beautiful. He who would be my chief must not
want me to run away from helping and giving. He must
help me to serve my people. The Great Spirit has answered
by fire and I am content. I will stay here and
serve my people in the way my mother taught me to do,
and I will wait for the one whom the Great Spirit will
send to me some day to be my Chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then slowly Fleetfoot picked his way over the narrow
trail in the darkness, and, because it was late, the white
man had come and gone away alone. But Litahni, bending
low over the couch where her father should sleep,
smiled as she stretched the skins in place for the night.
Even as the animals had given their skins that her father
might be warm, so she was ready to give her little light
to make him happy and comfortable, even as Owaissa,
her noble mother, had done.</p>
<p>And Litahni was content.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
<h2>A PARABLE OF GIRLHOOD</h2>
</div>

<p>Behold a girl went forth to walk on the highway
leading to life. And as she walked there grew up
beneath her feet flowers of every kind and color.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said, &#8220;I will gather a sheaf of flowers
to carry with me, for then, surely, I shall be welcome
when I come to the gate at the end of this way. I will
gather what seemeth to me to be the most beautiful of
all the flowers that grow about me. They shall be my
gift to the one who guards the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as she plucked, the one that seemed to be most
wonderful was the one most bright, gleaming yellow as
the sun. &#8220;It is yellow like gold,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If I come
with the sign of gold, I shall be welcome. I will pluck
it everywhere I can and carry only yellow flowers.&#8221;
And soon her arms were full, but somehow her fingers
seemed hot and unpleasant and her arms were heavy, so
she dropped some by the way and carried only those that
seemed most desirable.</p>
<p>But some were blue&mdash;blue as the sky. &#8220;Blue for blue
blood,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Those of royal birth are always to
be desired. I shall make my sheaf largely of blue.&#8221; So
she added one here and another there till she was satisfied
that the sheaf would be of all the sheaves the most
beautiful. But the odor was sickening, and again one
after another was dropped till only a few remained.</p>
<p>And some flowers there were in the path that were
red. &#8220;One needs fewer of these,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but surely
some must be red. I shall put red flowers for courage
where they shall be seen, for courage is of all the virtues
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
to be desired.&#8221; But there were thorns on the red flowers
and, try as she would, she could not hide the thorns so
that they might not pierce her flesh. So there could be
few of the red in the sheaf.</p>
<p>Some plants there were that bore no blossoms but the
leaves were beautiful, so she added leaves of this and of
that, even though she knew that in some there was deadly
poison. &#8220;I can hide it among the rest. It is so beautiful
that it must be a part of my sheaf,&#8221; thought the girl.</p>
<p>But along the way, there had been many flowers that
had been passed unnoticed. White they were. Often
they were small but always they were pure and sweet.
Only once had she plucked one and then she had added
it because of its fragrance. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I know
white is for purity but white flowers are old-fashioned.
Of course I must have a few but many would spoil my
sheaf. It must be bright with color.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the days flew by and her sheaf was nearly complete.
She had thought it the most beautiful thing she could
possibly make. But one day as she walked, suddenly she
saw, standing erect by the road, a beautiful, stately lily.
Its beauty startled her. She stooped to smell of its
fragrance. Then she glanced from it to the flowers in
her sheaf.</p>
<p>If she plucked the lily and tried to place it in the sheaf,
its beauty would be spoiled. What should she do? With
all her heart she longed to take the lily with her to the
end of the way. Should she throw the rest away?
Would she be welcome with only the one flower? Long
she hesitated.</p>
<p>Then she laid the yellow, and the blue, and the red, and
the rest aside and carefully gathered it. So in her hand
she carried the lily with the petals of pure white and the
heart of gold.</p>
<p>And lo, she had come to the stile which endeth the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
way of girlhood. There, standing guard over the way
ahead, was a woman in white, holding by the hand a
tiny, little child. Looking straight into the eyes of the
girl, she said sweetly,</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome, my child, from the beautiful way of girlhood.
What hast thou brought as thy gift to coming
generations?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the girl feared to answer. But she held the lily
toward the little child as she said, &#8220;I have brought purity
and a heart of gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast done well,&#8221; said the mother spirit. &#8220;Take
thou the child as thy reward. With this as thy gift, thou
art worthy to enter the way of motherhood. Lo, here are
some of the flowers that were left by the way. Well may
they go with thee, for they are very beautiful. But the
gift that thou didst choose was far more valuable and
beautiful than they. It was the gift that the Great desire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the girl and the child went together into the new
way. But the child was carrying the gift and she smiled
as she went.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE OF TRUTH</h2>
</div>

<p>It was plain to be seen that Bess Keats was very much
disturbed about something. She sat in the couch
hammock on the porch, talking to herself and occasionally
giving a sharp punch to the sofa pillow by her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother is so old-fashioned,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;and
she gets worse every year. Last year she wouldn&#8217;t let
me wear the kind of dresses I wanted to and I looked
different from the rest of the girls all the year. Then
she wouldn&#8217;t let me go camping with the party because
only one mother was going to take care of us. Surely
one woman can take care of twenty boys and girls. Of
course I was glad I hadn&#8217;t gone when they had the accident
and partly burned the cottage, but she wouldn&#8217;t
let me go just because she had old-fashioned notions.
Girls these days don&#8217;t do as they did when she was
young.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t see a reason in the world why I shouldn&#8217;t
invite Henry Mann to take me to the leap-year party at
the beach. Every girl in the crowd is asking a fellow
to take her. Of course if George were here, mother
might let me go with him; but he isn&#8217;t and all the girls
want Henry to go because he spends his money in such
a dandy way; so I said I would invite him to take me,
never thinking for a minute that mother would object.
And now she says, not only that I can&#8217;t ask him, but that
I can&#8217;t go. Well, I will, anyway. So there! I just
will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Bess pushed her head far down in the pillow
to think out a way. If grandmother were only alive she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
would help her. She had always found a way to get
what Bess wanted. But grandmother was dead and Bess
must work it out alone, so she began to think.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard a voice saying,</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Bessie dear, whatever is the matter? You look
very unhappy. Tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was grandmother with the neat, black silk
dress and the dainty white collar, and even the pretty
white apron that she used to wear. Oh! Oh! how glad
Bess was to see her!</p>
<p>Hand in hand, they went away from the house to
where the trees in the orchard were bending with fruit,
and, sitting there on a stone, Bess told her all about her
trouble. Whatever would the girls think of her when
she had promised to invite the boy they all wanted? And
after she had told it every bit, she squeezed grandma&#8217;s
hand very hard and said,</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Granny dear, you will help me, won&#8217;t you?
It is perfectly all right to ask him for all the girls do it.
I want him to take me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, dear,&#8221; said the grandmother, &#8220;if we find
that it is all right, I shall be glad to find a way to help
you. But we must see. We must see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See what, grandmother?&#8221; asked the girl. &#8220;There is
nothing to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed there is, child,&#8221; said Granny. &#8220;In times of
trouble one must always see the Truth. Then the way is
easy. After I see the Truth, I shall be able to tell what
to do. Come and we shall soon find out. You see you
belong to my family and my family is proud of the fact
that its girls have all been ladies. So we must go to the
keeper of the book and see what a lady can do in this
case.&#8221;</p>
<p>On and on they went till they came to a queer little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
old man standing before a big, big book. Granny went
daintily up to him and said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me if it is ever right for a young lady
to ask a strange young man to take her to a dance, and
pay out his money for her, when he has not even been
to her home or met her mother? My grandchild says
all the girls do it, so I suppose it must be a new thing
that has been written in the book since I was a girl. I
want her to be sure to be a lady, so before I help her to
ask the boy to take her, I want you to look for the
rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little old man began slowly to shake his head but
he never said a word. He just looked and looked and
looked. His finger went up one page and down another.
Finally he looked straight at Bess and said to Granny,</p>
<p>&#8220;Your granddaughter is mistaken. That is not done
by ladies. It is not here. It is not here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are old-fashioned just like my mother,&#8221; began
Bess. &#8220;It may not be there but it is true just the
same that all ladies do it nowadays.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, child,&#8221; said Granny. &#8220;What is written there
is true&mdash;but it is only half the truth even then. Let us
go and see the rest. If it is right for you to ask him,
then let us see the truth about the boy. Is he one that
our family would like to have specially chosen for your
friend? We must know about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Granny, he is all right. He doesn&#8217;t study much
and he doesn&#8217;t do what mother believes is right on Sunday.
But he has a car, and a motor boat, and he is all
right. Let me ask him,&#8221; begged Bess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, child,&#8221; said Granny. &#8220;Perhaps you do not
know. This is the House of Truth and we can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they entered a very large house and Granny
walked to a man who stood near the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I go to the M room?&#8221; she asked, with a smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will show you the way, lady,&#8221; said the man, and Bess
noted how the man had spoken the word &#8220;lady.&#8221; Somehow
every one knew as soon as they looked at Granny
that she was a lady. &#8217;Twas very strange!</p>
<p>Down a long hall they went and then they stood before
a large wall of mirrors. What a strange place this was!
Before them in the mirror were many, many men and
boys, all struggling to get up a very steep hill. Some
had a few strings ahead of them to help them up and
many, many strings behind that were pulling them back
to the foot of the hill. Others had only a few in back
and many in front. Some were hopelessly entangled and
seemed not able to move. Who were they and what were
they doing?</p>
<p>Curiosity led Bess to study the scene in front of her.
On the very top of the hill there was a bright sign,
&#8220;Christian Manhood.&#8221; This, then, was the thing for
which they were struggling. But what were the strings?
She pushed and reached but she just couldn&#8217;t read the
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want to know the truth about a friend?&#8221; said
a voice. &#8220;I will gladly help you for you are young and
need to know. I am old and to know the truth may only
make me more unhappy. Take my place.&#8221; And she was
given a nearer stand.</p>
<p>Now she could read the words on the strings that held
the men back. One said &#8220;Drink&#8221; and another &#8220;Bad Companions,&#8221;
and another &#8220;Bad Temper.&#8221; Bess was very
much interested, so she began to study the faces of the
men who were pushing to the top.</p>
<p>Why! Away up there with the first was George
Meyer, her good friend from childhood. He had many,
many strings to help and only a few to hinder. And
there was Edward Mead. He was such a goody-goody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
at school that she didn&#8217;t care much for him. Why, he
wouldn&#8217;t whisper at all!</p>
<p>Near the middle of the hill was Philip Marks. She
knew him well and he had many things to help and many
to hinder but he was surely trying. But Granny had
brought her here to see the truth about Henry Mann.
Was he here? She hadn&#8217;t seen him.</p>
<p>First she searched among those near the top. He was
such a bright boy when out with the crowd and he had
so many good things in his life that surely he must be
near the top. But he wasn&#8217;t there. Neither was he near
the middle. Surely he must be there somewhere for his
name began with M. Finally she asked the man who
had given her his place if he could see a boy named Henry
Mann on the hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say I could,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;There he
is near the foot of the hill, hopelessly entangled in his
drawbacks. It isn&#8217;t hard to find that young man here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, there he was and Bess&#8217;s face grew very
red as she saw all the strings behind him. She was glad
Granny had gone to sit down so that she wouldn&#8217;t see
him. Perhaps she could read what some of his drawbacks
were, for he was quite near. There was, &#8220;Too
much money,&#8221; &#8220;Lazy,&#8221; &#8220;Unkind to his mother,&#8221; &#8220;Little
schooling,&#8221; &#8220;Drinks and smokes and swears,&#8221; &#8220;A
friend of careless girls&#8221;....</p>
<p>Oh, dear! Bess didn&#8217;t want to read any more. What a
list he had! There were one or two good strings but
they could not do much against so many others to pull
him back.</p>
<p>Up there very near to the top, George, her old friend,
was moving on and his face was so earnest. How different
it looked as she compared him with Henry at the
foot! She had never known before that he was so
handsome. What were the strings that were pulling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
him forward? She leaned far forward to see. Just then
she heard Granny&#8217;s voice close at her elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you trying to look at George, Bess? He is a
long way toward manhood, isn&#8217;t he? Suppose you use
my little glass to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now I can see,&#8221; she answered. There is &#8220;A good
mother,&#8221; &#8220;A keen mind,&#8221; &#8220;A strong body,&#8221; &#8220;Love of
right and truth,&#8221; &#8220;A good girl friend&#8221;....</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Granny dear,&#8221; said Bess, &#8220;one of his helps is &#8216;A
good girl friend.&#8217; Has George a girl? I thought he
didn&#8217;t care for girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the House of Truth, dear,&#8221; said the old lady.
&#8220;I think perhaps that good girl friend means you, for
you have been a good friend to him. You know our
family have always been proud of their education and
their habits of life. I am sure it must have been a good
thing for George to grow up all these years with a good
chum like you. He must be a gentleman if he would be
fit to play with the daughter of a lady like your mother.
When I was here before, George had several other pull-backs,
but I see he has conquered them. But come, dear,
it is time we were going if I am to help you out of your
difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see, you wanted to ask Henry Mann to take
you to a party at the beach. Did you find him there?
Do you think your mother will change her mind when
we tell her the truth about the new friend whom you
wish to make? If so, I am ready to try, even though I
am not at all sure that a lady does those things. But
things change&mdash;things change very much and perhaps
you are right. What said the House of Truth? Shall
we invite him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Granny, never, never!&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;I could
never ask any one who was known as the friend of careless
girls. He has so many drawbacks&mdash;oh, no, never.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>Just then a voice said, &#8220;Good evening, Miss Keats. I
hope I haven&#8217;t disturbed your nap. One of the girls told
me you were very anxious to see me, so I came up.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there stood Henry Mann.</p>
<p>For a moment the girl could not answer. The face
that had looked so handsome when it was pointed out
to her on the street yesterday now looked careless and
insolent. She wanted to run away and not even answer.</p>
<p>But just at that moment the door opened and her
mother came out. She was dressed so prettily and her
voice was soft and sweet as she said, &#8220;I think I haven&#8217;t
met you, but you must be one of my daughter&#8217;s friends.
Will you be seated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man must be a gentleman if he would be fit to play
with the daughter of a lady like your mother,&#8221; thought
Bess.</p>
<p>Then she straightened her shoulders and, smiling, said,
&#8220;Mother, this is Henry Mann, of whom I spoke to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to the boy, who still stood at the top of the
steps, she said, &#8220;Thank you so much for calling, Mr.
Mann. There has been a mistake. Mother prefers that
I should not go to the party at the beach and of course
I want to do as she thinks best. I am sorry to have
made you this trouble. Perhaps one of the other girls
will be asked to fill my place so that you can still be one
of the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Henry Mann tipped his hat and went down the
street thinking how beautiful the mother and daughter
were. But Bess and her mother stood there with their
arms about each other, waiting for father to come home
to tea. And Bess was no longer unhappy.</p>

<h2>MARKED FOR A MAST</h2>
</div>

<p>Mary had just come from the little post-office in the
town where she was spending the summer, and in
her hand she held a bunch of letters. Mail time was the
event of the day, and all the summer people flocked about
the office as soon as the little boat carrying the mail was
heard blowing her whistle below the bend.</p>
<p>To-day Mary had been very impatient as the old postmaster
had slowly sorted the mail. She had watched
him look carefully at one address after another, and,
knowing him as she did, she was sure that many in the
town would know by night how many interesting letters
had come to people in the town. She had been almost
the first at the little window for her mail and then had
had to brave the laugh of the rest when Mr. Blake had
said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your letter and it&#8217;s a fat one that took four
cents. My, but he must like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mary had been waiting for this very letter because in
the last one George had said, &#8220;I have a big surprise in
store for you but I can&#8217;t tell you yet&mdash;maybe in the next
letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>So this long one must be the surprise. Eagerly she
tore it open and read the first two pages that told of
things happening in the home town and good times the
young people were having. Then she read,</p>
<p>&#8220;And now for my secret. You know we are going to
our camp for a whole month of fun in August. Mother
likes you and you are such good company for us all that
she tells me to write in her name and ask you to spend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the first two weeks with us there. Don&#8217;t say no for we&mdash;no,
I&mdash;must surely have you to share our good times.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first two weeks! Those were the weeks she had
planned to go to the conference and train for some special
work for the church during the coming winter. The
church had said they would pay her expenses if she cared
to go, and already she had made application. Oh, dear!
Now what should she do? She had said to her pastor,
&#8220;I want to go to the conference more than anything I
have ever wanted but I can&#8217;t afford to go.&#8221; Now she
wanted to go with her friends and she would have to say
to him, &#8220;I want a good time more than I want the conference.&#8221;
The conference would come again the next
year, but this invitation might never come again.</p>
<p>To be sure, she had many, many good times. Maybe
she would have a good time at the conference. Which
did she want the more? If she went with her friends, she
could not do the winter work at the church as it ought
to be done. But there was the last sentence. &#8220;We&mdash;no,
I&mdash;must have you to share our good times.&#8221; That meant
a lot to her as she read it. Should she go to the conference
or should she go to the camp?</p>
<p>Mechanically she turned the other letters over. There
was one from mother, and one from a school friend, and
a business letter&mdash;oh, here was a correspondence card
from Mrs. Lane, her teacher in the Church School.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mrs. Lane,&#8221; thought Mary. &#8220;How I should
love to see her! She was going to Maine. I wonder if
this little snapshot is a picture of some pines where she
is staying.&#8221;</p>
<p>After looking long at the beautiful, tall pines in the
picture, she turned to the card and read,</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mary</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;As we came up the beautiful Sebago Lake last week,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
I saw something that reminded me of you so strongly
that I must tell you of it. Away off in the distance, we
saw some wonderful pines that towered high above the
rest. They seemed so tall that we spoke to the pilot of
the boat about them and he told us this story about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Years and years ago, before this land was settled by
any but the Indians, King George of England sent men
to this country to look for tall trees that would make
good masts for his ships. They went up the rivers and
lakes looking everywhere for the special trees. Here
on these hills they found these great trees. So the men
marked &#8220;K.G.&#8221; on the trees, charted them on a map
which they carried, and went on their way. But for
some reason they were never cut and carried away to
be used on his ships. There they stand to-day, strong
and straight, marked for masts.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;After the old man had finished his story and had
left us, I said to my friend, &#8216;Marked for a mast because
it is straight and strong. I have a girl who also is
marked for a mast and some day she will carry with her,
under her colors, many boys and girls. We are sending
her to the leaders&#8217; conference this summer so that she
may begin to make ready for her work.&#8217; Mary, dear,
it is wonderful to have been chosen by the King of England
and to have been marked for use with his initials,
but it is more wonderful to have been chosen by a greater
king and marked with his name. Perhaps you can guess
what the mark I see on you might be&mdash;It is C. L. Write
and tell me all about the conference, won&#8217;t you?</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Lovingly your friend,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Margaret Lane</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>&#8217;Twas a very thoughtful girl who went down the
street. In one hand a long letter and in the other a closely
written card. The one said, &#8220;Come and have a real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
jolly, good time.&#8221; The other said, &#8220;Get ready for service.&#8221;
Which should it be?</p>
<p>As she sat in the hammock thinking of her good
friend in Maine, there came again to her mind the last
night Mrs. Lane had been with them. They had been
talking over plans for the summer and Mrs. Lane had
quietly said, &#8220;I like to think that a good time is one which
you carry with you and which means more to you as the
weeks go by than it did when you were enjoying it.&#8221;
Which good time would she carry with her longer?
Which would make of her the finer girl? Which did
she want most to carry with her? And as she thought,
the way became clearer.</p>
<p>Finally she went to her room and returned in a few
minutes with a writing case and pen.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Dear George,&#8221; she began. &#8220;Weren&#8217;t you good to
ask me to go with the family to the camp! I can&#8217;t think
of any camp where I would enjoy myself more and I
surely appreciate the invitation. But I can&#8217;t accept it
this time for that is the time set for the conference to
which I am really going this year. Our church has made
it possible for me to go, and I know it will do much in
getting me ready to be of help to those who have helped
me so much. I shall have so much more to give when
I have studied for the two weeks with those who know,
and have given their lives to the service of others. &#8217;Tis
an opportunity that I couldn&#8217;t miss&mdash;not even for two
weeks with you all. Thank you just the same.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Mary read the letter, then as she sealed it, she said
with a smile, &#8220;Marked for a mast! Marked for a mast!
Surely I mustn&#8217;t bend or break if I can be a mast some
day and carry a king&#8217;s colors. C. L.?... C. L.?...
Ah, I have it. &#8217;Tis the word that Mrs. Lane uses so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
often&mdash;a Christian Leader! &#8217;Tis wonderful to have her
think I have been chosen to bear such a splendid name.
I can hardly wait to meet the rest of the girls, who also
wear the mark of the King, who will be there at the conference.
I may be&mdash;oh, I hope I am&mdash;marked for a
mast.&#8221;</p>

<h2>HER NEED</h2>
</div>

<p>She was just a girl with a foreign name, a foreign
face and a bit still of a foreign dress. But she was
a girl, just the same, and her face was full of longing.
Her home was near to a settlement where many girls
came for lessons and for play. But somehow they had
never asked her to come, though often she had sat on
the steps at night where they must pass her. She had
seen them come with their arms about each other, talking
and laughing and singing&mdash;and when they had passed,
she had gone to her lonely hall bedroom and hidden her
face in the pillow.</p>
<p>Oh, no, she didn&#8217;t cry. She was too brave to cry.
She just suffered alone and longed for help.</p>
<p>It had been a year since she had left the home across
the sea and had come to join her father in the land
where &#8220;work was plenty and friends were easily made.&#8221;
But she had found her father living where she could not
and would not live. The friends he had made in America
she could not and would not have for hers. So when
she had grown proficient enough in the factory, she had
gone to live in that loneliest of all lonely places&mdash;a boarding
house.</p>
<p>The days had passed one by one. Some of the boarders
called her fussy; some said she was cold; some said she
was &#8220;stuck-up&#8221; and none of them had found that beneath
the surface there was a sweet, gentle, lonely heart.</p>
<p>Then came the strike&mdash;and she was out of work. In
the bank she had a few dollars but they had soon fled
and now&mdash;oh, what could she do? The way was so black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
ahead. She couldn&#8217;t go to her father and his friends.
What could she do?</p>
<p>The girls passed her as they went to the settlement
house but no one noticed her sad little face. So she
slowly rose and wended her way down the street. Out
of the poorer section she went, then down a long avenue
till she came to a great church. The altar lights were
lighted. All was quiet and restful, so she sat, and
looked, and listened for the still, small voice that she
longed to hear.</p>
<p>A long, long time she sat there, counting her beads.
Then she slowly rose and entered the confessional, but
when she came out there was still the look of longing in
her face. Toward the altar she went. Perhaps in the
communion she might find help for her troubled soul,
and again she counted her beads.</p>
<p>But, somehow, there was no prayer on the beads that
seemed just what she wanted to say. Again, she went
to the altar. But this time she lifted a face, white with
suffering and thin from lack of food, to the face of the
Christ above the altar and from the depths of her heart
she prayed,</p>
<p>&#8220;O God! My God! I do not ask for money, though
I am hungry. I do not ask for a home, though I am oh!
so very lonely. I do not ask for work, though I have
none. For only one thing I ask. Give me a friend. Oh,
give me a friend! For Jesus&#8217; sake. Amen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she walked back through the avenue and down
the narrow street to her only home. The doors of the
settlement were opened and the girls came out, happy as
birds in the springtime. Quietly she watched them as
they came nearer. Then suddenly one of them stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me for speaking to you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but our
guardian heard that you lived in this house, so she asked
us to come and invite you to come to Camp Fire with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
us next Tuesday. We are to have a supper together so
that you will soon know us all and then we are to go
for a hike together. Shall we stop for you as we go?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment she could not answer. In her throat
was a lump so big that she could not swallow. Then
she said in a low, sweet voice,</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I should like to go. Thank you for asking
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the girls passed down the street, singing their
Camp Fire song.</p>
<p>But up in the little hall bedroom there was a girl with
a foreign name, and a foreign face, and a bit of a foreign
dress. She was on her knees, looking up at the heavens
full of stars and over and over she was saying, &#8220;Oh,
I thank thee. I thank thee. I have a chance to be a
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>And her heart was content.</p>

<h2>THE MESSAGE OF THE MOUNTAIN</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth.&#8221;... &#8220;Lo, I am with you alway, even unto
the end of the world.&#8221; These were the two sentences
that were neatly written on two pieces of paper on
Marcia Loran&#8217;s desk and the girl sat looking at them
while the minutes went steadily by. How could they be?
How could a power that made the earth be also in her
life? How could it be?</p>
<p>Marcia had always been a reader of her Bible; she had
always loved her mother&#8217;s God and she loved Him now,
but she was longing for help and no one seemed near to
give it. And the reason for the need of this help was
easy to give. The new girl who had moved into the
next room had been laughing at her belief in God and
Marcia knew no way to answer. She had hoped that her
course in Bible at college would help her but somehow
she seemed less able than ever to answer it now.</p>
<p>Who was God? Where was God? How could she
know that these two verses could both be true? It was
an honest doubt and she knew she must answer it before
her mind could be at rest. She felt she could never
ask the question in a letter to her mother, for mother
must never know that she was questioning. Oh, if only
some one knew how much she needed help!</p>
<p>But it was time for the picnic which the members of
her class were to have, so she slipped the papers again
into her Bible and went to the campus. They were to
climb one of the mountains near by and dear old Professor
Hastings was to be their guide. Old in years but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
young in heart and lithe still in limb, he stood out
among the students as one of the best of the companions.
As they climbed, Marcia kept near to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for a rare little flower which
grows on this mountainside. Perhaps you can help me
find it. It is very tiny and it grows in the crevice of the
rock. But I am needing a specimen of it for my collection.&#8221;</p>
<p>So together they looked in every crevice but not a bit
of the little white blossom did they see.</p>
<p>Up, and up, and up they went. Some were tired and
waited for the rest to climb and return. Some even went
back down the mountainside. But when the top was
reached, what a wonderful view spread out before them!
Mountains and lakes and streams; villages and cities and
lonely farms; beauty and calmness and majesty, all seemed
to flood in at once on the minds and hearts of those who
looked.</p>
<p>After they had rested a while, the old man lightly
touched the hand of the girl and said,</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard it said that one of my blossoms has
been found on that cliff not far away. Will you come
with me to see?&#8221;</p>
<p>So they began to search the cliff; then they found a
hidden cave and explored that; Marcia heard a tiny stream
of water trickling in the cave, and when she had found
the water, she found also, close to the water&#8217;s edge, a
beautiful clump of waxy white blossoms, sweet and
fragrant, and hanging tightly to the rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! oh! Come, sir,&#8221; called the girl. &#8220;I am sure
these are what you seek. Oh, how beautiful they are!&#8221;
And they stooped to gather them.</p>
<p>But just at that moment a flash of lightning lighted
the cave and the thunder rolled. In a moment the rain
was coming in torrents, and the noise of the thunder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
as it rolled from cliff to cliff was terrifying. A giant
pine tree which stood just before the entrance of the
cave was rent from top to bottom and went crashing
down the mountainside. The noise of the wind and
storm was deafening. Pale and trembling, the girl pushed
farther and farther into the cave till, crouching down,
she touched something cool. It was the little white
flowers.</p>
<p>They were not afraid. The rain might fall as hard
as it would but it would not blast their beauty. They
were protected by a bit of overhanging rock. The lightning
might flash about the cave but it was calm inside.
Who had made the tiny blossoms to grow here in the
rock, protected from storm and blast? God! She, too,
was being cared for while her companions might be in
the fury of the storm. Who was caring for her? Her
friend? No, he was interested in something at the entrance
of the cave. God was caring for her even as he
cared for the little blossom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Marcia, come and watch the storm,&#8221; called the
professor. &#8220;I have never seen such a beautiful one.
Isn&#8217;t it strange that that electricity was all there in the
clouds as we came up the mountain though we knew it
not? I love to watch a storm for it shows so clearly the
power and majesty of our God. Watch the trees bend
with the wind! Listen to the rocks send back the sound
of the thunder! See the little bird on yonder nest snuggling
close to keep the little ones safe! And see, far
away, the sun shining on the little village of the plain.
We are in the storm, child, yet we are safe and sheltered.&#8221;</p>
<p>With her hand held fast in that of her old friend, the
fear gradually died away, and when the storm was over
she, too, was glad she had seen from the mountaintop
the wonder of a mountain storm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>Soon they gathered the little white blossoms, but not
all of them found their way into the collection at the college.
A little spray was tenderly pressed between the
leaves of Marcia Loran&#8217;s Bible and a third little slip of
paper was fastened to the other two. It read: &#8220;God is
great but God is love. I will trust him and not be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<h2>THE WINNING OF AN HONOR</h2>
</div>

<p>Barbara Lewis was very much puzzled. All the
girls in her camp fire were winning the right to embroider
their symbol on the dress of their guardian and
she wanted to do the same. But how could she? She
had chosen for her name, &#8220;Chante&mdash;I <i>serve</i>,&#8221; and she
wanted to really win the right to have the name, but how
could she? She was not allowed to go into the kitchen
to help there at home, for the cook would leave if she
were disturbed, so she couldn&#8217;t do as some of her friends
were doing and learn to cook. She couldn&#8217;t serve mother,
for mother was always away at the club or doing work
about the country for the suffrage cause. There were
maids to do the mending and the sewing, so how could
she serve there?</p>
<p>Some of the girls could serve at their church, but her
teacher had never asked her to do one thing, though she
was always ready. Her teacher had not formed a club
of her girls, so of course she knew them only on Sundays.
There was no chance to serve the church. If she only
knew the minister, perhaps he would suggest a way, but
he was very tall and very dignified, so she just couldn&#8217;t
ask him. Whatever could she do?</p>
<p>It had been weeks since their guardian had told them
that when they had earned the right to their names, they
could embroider the symbol on her dress, and every day
since then she had wished she knew what to do. Mary
had chosen the name &#8220;Aka&mdash;I <i>can</i>,&#8221; and when she had
proved that she could break herself of using slang by
using none for a whole month, she put a tiny little white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
flower on the dress, for she was using pure speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frilohe&#8221; was the name Grace had chosen and it
meant, &#8220;<i>A friend who loves to help</i>.&#8221; Grace&#8217;s mother
had been in the hospital and Grace had taken care of the
brothers and sisters all the time, so, of course, they all
agreed that she had earned the right.</p>
<p>And now Barbara felt that she just must think of a
way. She would go to the library and ask her friend
there if she knew what she could do to serve.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that from that library there were going
out almost every day girls to tell stories to groups of
children about the city. Sometimes they went to the
orphan homes, sometimes to the hospitals, sometimes to
the crowded streets. Into many needy places they were
sent, and already the children were beginning to look for
the gypsy-girls who were story-tellers. As Barbara entered
the library, one of the girls was just leaving, so she
stopped for a moment and told about her new work and
how much she loved it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha,&#8221; said Barbara, &#8220;I believe I could do that. I
have read such lots and lots of stories, I am sure I could
do that. I should love to try. But they haven&#8217;t asked
me. I couldn&#8217;t volunteer, for mother would think me
very bold. Oh dear, I am sure I could serve in that
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the way home she thought the matter over and
then a plan came to her. Just back of the house there was
an alley and the little children there were always looking
through the fence at the flowers in her beautiful garden.
She would tell stories to these little children and see what
she could do. So she went into the house to find the
stories she would use. All the afternoon she looked in
her old books. Then she was sure she was ready.</p>
<p>For a long time she hesitated the next morning as she
dressed. She must look her very best if she was to win
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
the children. Finally she chose a little blue gingham dress
that she liked much&mdash;perhaps they would like it too. It
was only ten o&#8217;clock when she went into the garden to
wait. Dear me! Weren&#8217;t they coming this morning? One
hour passed and then another half.</p>
<p>Just then Tommy, the boy who threw stones, and
chased the cats, and did all sorts of things that were
naughty, pushed his dirty face against the fence. Oh my,
she could never tell stories to him! But Tommy saw her
there in the garden and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht you would give me a posy. Mom&#8217;s sick and
she hain&#8217;t got none.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the gate of the garden was opened and Barbara
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will give you some flowers for your
mother. Choose what you would like and I will cut it
with these shears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um! Um!&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;Um! I&#8217;d like some of
them blue flowers. Say, I like blue flowers, and blue sky,
and I like that blue dress. I wish Mary had a blue
dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is Mary?&#8221; said Barbara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she is one of my sisters,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;You
see, there is six of us and Mary is the pretty one. She
has blue eyes and curls. Um! Um! I wish you could
see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see her,&#8221; said Barbara. &#8220;If you will go
and bring her here I will tell you both a story. Would
you like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Tommy. &#8220;Sure I would. Kin I bring
them all?&#8221; and off he ran with his precious flowers.</p>
<p>In five minutes he was back, followed by Mary and
Katie and Jimmie and Mike and Susan&mdash;all dirty, all
barefoot, and all in a hurry to see the flowers and hear
the story. About this time Barbara began to feel queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
inside. How could she ever keep them still? Suppose
they should begin to run over her father&#8217;s flowers! She
almost wished she had not asked them to come. But she
remembered for what she was working, and she said to
herself, &#8220;Chante, <i>I serve</i>; Chante&mdash;<i>I serve</i>,&#8221; over and
over till her courage came back.</p>
<p>Then she seated them all on the steps and began. Susie
wanted &#8220;Red Riding Hood,&#8221; and Katie wanted &#8220;Goldilocks,&#8221;
so these were first. Then Mary wanted &#8220;Cinderella,&#8221;
but Tommy was not to be forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a boy&#8217;s story. Tell me the one you promised
me or I&#8217;ll push the rest all home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>What could she do? She never remembered having
read a boy&#8217;s story. Oh dear, maybe she couldn&#8217;t win
Tommy.</p>
<p>Over and over in her mind went the stories she had
gotten ready. Then she remembered one that she had
loved years ago. It was about Cedric, the Knight. This
was just the one for Tommy. So she told it to him
while his eyes grew bigger and bigger. When the story
was done, Barbara and Tommy were friends and Tommy
had a new hero.</p>
<p>When the dinner bell rang, she was still telling stories
to the dirty little group but she had forgotten why she
was doing it, for she was living the stories with the children.</p>
<p>The days went by and every morning found Barbara
out in the garden, if only for one story, but now the
Lowinskys were not the only ones. They had brought
their neighbors and friends till the group sometimes numbered
forty. The steps had grown too small, so they had
moved to the wall. Then that had not been satisfactory,
so they had moved out under the trees away down by the
little brook. Here the birds sang, the little brook whispered,
and everything was just right for the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
story-teller. Over and over she had told the stories with a new
one now and then, but Cedric, the Knight, was the favorite
one. Tommy always stood near Barbara and saw to
it that all the boys were listening, so he had a fine chance
to whisper, &#8220;Now my story. Please tell mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she was telling it again one morning when she
realized that some one stood near who was not a child. It
was Miss Rose, her guardian, who listened for a moment
and then drew back where the children could not see her.
When the story hour was over, she was nowhere to be
seen. But later in the evening a package was left at the
door for Barbara. It contained that precious dress for
which she had longed.</p>
<p>Pinned to the dress was a card which said, &#8220;Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of these, my little ones, ye
have done it unto me.&#8221; And below was written, &#8220;I shall
be glad to have you put your symbol on my dress before
Friday night so that we may tell the girls at the Ceremonial
about your story-group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later when Barbara had finished the embroidery, it
showed a tiny figure of a primitive woman surrounded
by little children. And the little lady was telling them a
story. She had found her way to serve.</p>

<h2>DADDY GRAY&#8217;S TEST</h2>
</div>

<p>May Langley had spent four happy years at the
University, and now Commencement time had
come. It had been easy for her to get her lessons, so she
had had time to herself. She was pretty and was always
well dressed; she could dance well and sing well, so of
course she had been a favorite, especially with the boys.</p>
<p>But the coming of the end of the school life had
brought to her a real problem. She knew some of the
boys would want to write to her. Deep in her heart she
knew that some of them already liked her more than a
little. She could not write to all of them. Whom should
she choose? Perhaps the one she chose would eventually
be the one she should marry, so it was wise to choose with
care. Over and over she turned the question in her
mind.</p>
<p>There was Tom,&mdash;gay, careless Tom with a big heart
and plenty of money. His father was an oil man and
there was no other child. He had done little with his
studies but he had given her many a good time. His life
would probably be one of ease. Tom was really quite
attractive.</p>
<p>Then there was Bob, the football player. Already his
name was known throughout the country. It was great
fun to go to games where he was to play, for she shared
the honors with him afterward. He was rough and
ready, and, at times, a bit too boisterous, but withal a
good fellow.</p>
<p>Then there was Earl, the student. He had ranked first
in his class but his books were all in all to him. A good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
position was waiting for him in a neighboring college and
he had told her that he should marry so that he could
have a home of his own to which the students might
come.</p>
<p>There were others, too, but these three seemed to stand
out first in her thoughts. How could she decide? She
and her mother were alone in the world and mother was
a helpless cripple and so could not come to the Commencement.
For the first time in her life, she began to
face the future seriously.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas the Sunday of Commencement week and she was
strolling across the campus when she saw in the distance
dear, old Professor Gray&mdash;Daddy Gray, the girls
called him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the very person to help me,&#8221; she said to herself,
and hurried to catch him before he left the campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy Gray,&#8221; she began, &#8220;I have a queer question to
ask you. I am choosing some boy friends whom I wish to
have as friends after I leave. Tell me some principles on
which to base my choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>A rare smile crossed the face of the old man as he
patted her golden hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you! I am glad you are thinking. Long,
long ago when my own girlies were choosing their friends
I asked them to remember two things as they chose&mdash;not
only that the one they chose might be their husband,
but that he also might be my son, and the father of their
children. One thinks much more about the principles
of the man who is to be father of their children than
about the man whom they love and want to marry. You
know what a high ideal your mother holds. Test your
friends by that also. Never mind yourself&mdash;think of
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he left her to think.</p>
<p>And she did think! If Tom ignored her mother as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
did his own, she could never bring him into their home.
Tom drank sometimes&mdash;oh, that would never do. Bob
was strong and healthy&mdash;but Bob had no use for God and
the church. Her children must have a Christian home.
Earl was a wonderful student, but he had undermined his
health. He stooped in his shoulders and there were signs
of a breakdown. Oh dear, what a hard test Daddy Gray
had given her!</p>
<p>So the days wore away and she found herself watching
as she had never watched before for marks of strength&mdash;mental,
moral and physical. Over and over the words
rang in her ears: &#8220;Never mind yourself&mdash;think of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas the afternoon of Commencement Day and her
room had many beautiful flowers. Tom&#8217;s bunch was of
great American Beauty roses and the card had made her
suddenly blush as she read it. But there had come in the
mail a great bunch of beautiful forget-me-nots, all fresh
with the dew in the grass. Who had sent them? She
loved them the best of all the flowers in the room. There
was no card to be found, so she tucked a few in her dress
beneath the cap and gown and ran away to the chapel.</p>
<p>There on the steps stood a young man and his mother,
and they were waiting for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;May, I want you to meet my mother, for I have told
her so much about you. To get her to come, I had to
drive all the way home to-day. But it is worth it, even
if I did have to get up before the sun did. She is the
very best mother in all the world,&#8221; said the boy, and he
squeezed the arm of the timid little lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe! Maybe! I am so glad to meet you,&#8221; said
the mother, &#8220;for I owe you much. You have helped Gene
such a lot. I am sure he would never have been able to
keep from smoking had it not been for you. He had
promised me to try. Then when you told him you did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
like it, why, we worked together, you see. And it has been
so kind of you to go for the hikes when he has asked you,
for you see he couldn&#8217;t have afforded to go to places that
cost money, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>May Langley opened her eyes wide. She had had no
idea that she had been helping. To be sure, she had gone
on many hikes with him after the geology class had
thrown them together. And she had enjoyed it, too, for
he was such good company. Always courteous, always
hunting for ways to make the trip more worth while and
always good natured, no matter what the weather, he had
been a companion worth while.</p>
<p>So she stood and talked with the mother and son for a
moment. How sweet the mother was and how proud he
was of her! It was a joy to watch them.</p>
<p>Suddenly he spied the bit of forget-me-not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I had nearly forgotten to speak of
them. I passed a brook lined with them just before time
for the mail train to pass the station, so I just hopped out
of the car, emptied my lunch from the box and sent them
to you. But I never dreamed you would get them in time
to wear them. Maybe the little flowers will tell you
that I am hoping you are going to remember our happy
days here after we leave the campus. I want much
to feel that you have a little interest in me. I have told
mother much about you, for mother and I have no secrets.
May I write to you sometimes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then the bell rang for the line to form and she hurried
away, while he took his mother into the chapel. All
afternoon they were busy and there was little time to
think. But when May came to dress for the ball in the
evening, she stood long before the flowers on the table.
Then a sprig of the forget-me-not went into her hair
and a bunch was fastened to her belt. And when he asked
her for her answer as they stood on the veranda of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
fraternity house, she said simply, &#8220;I have enjoyed the time
spent with you; I am quite sure that I should like to know
you better. You may write to me if you care to do
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>But under her breath she was saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy Gray is right. The greatest test of a man is
not what he might be to you, but what he is and will be
to others. I&#8217;m quite sure Gene Powell can stand his test
and mine also.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary King sat before the dressing-table in her bedroom
holding in her hand a string of beads&mdash;pearls
they were, but they showed signs of much wear, and as
Mary looked at them her eyes blazed with anger.</p>
<p>To-morrow was her graduation day from the High
School. All day she had been at the class picnic and she
had had such a glorious time. They had danced and
played; they had rowed on the lake and sung their school
songs in the moonlight. She had been as happy as a girl
could be, and to have it spoiled in this way was cruel.</p>
<p>Why should her mother give her a string of old beads
for a graduation present? Other girls had wrist watches
and pretty dresses and checks and all sorts of beautiful
things. When they asked her what her mother&#8217;s gift had
been, how could she say, &#8220;A string of old beads&#8221;? Mother
would expect her to wear them at her graduation and how
could she?</p>
<p>She had found them on her table when she had come
into her room and with them was a note saying:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mary</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I waited for you to come home so that I could give
you my gift, but it is so late and I am too tired to wait
longer, so I will leave them for you. I could not buy you
a real gift, so I have given you the dearest thing I have.
Every bead has a story which some day I will tell you&mdash;perhaps
on the day that you graduate from college, but
not now. I hope you will love them as I do. I shall see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
them to-morrow on your pretty new dress. Good night,
girlie. I hope you had a good time.</p>

<p>Why was mother so queer? All her life long it had
been hard for Mary to have her mother so different.
Her mother worked for Mr. Morse and so she could never
bring her friends to their rooms lest she should annoy
the Morses. Other girls&#8217; mothers had pretty faces and
her mother&#8217;s face was all red and cross-looking. Other
girls&#8217; mothers had pretty hair, but her mother had straight
hair and little of it. She had tried to get her to wear
false hair, but instead of doing it her mother had gone to
her room and cried because Mary had suggested it. Other
girls&#8217; mothers let them wear pretty clothes, but hers were
always plain, though they were always very neat. Most
of the girls had fancy graduation dresses, but hers was
only a little dimity that her mother had made&mdash;and now
these dreadful beads were more than she could stand and
she threw them on the bed in anger. She wished she had
a real mother of whom she could be proud.</p>
<p>As she started to take down her long, wavy hair, she
saw a letter in Mr. Morse&#8217;s handwriting on her desk.
Perhaps this was a check for her graduation present, so
she hastily tore it open. But no check dropped out. Instead,
there was a long letter, and she sat down to read.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;My dear Mary,&#8221; it began. &#8220;A few days ago, I
chanced to be on the beach when you were there with your
friend, and I heard you say to her, &#8216;I wish my mother
were as beautiful as yours. Mother can&#8217;t even go down
the street with me for she drags her foot so that everybody
turns and looks at us and it makes me feel so conspicuous.
You must be very proud of your mother.&#8217; So
I have decided that for your graduation gift, I shall give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
you a story instead of the check that I intended to give
you. The check can wait.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;A story,&#8221; said Mary to herself. &#8220;That is worse than
the old beads. What a house of queer people this is!
Anyway, I am curious to see what sort of a story he
could write.&#8221; So she read on.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Seventeen years ago there came to a town in the
eastern part of Pennsylvania a young man and his bride.
Just a slip of a girl she was, but her face was full of
sunshine and every one soon loved her. She had beautiful
wavy hair and bright, blue eyes and a cheery smile.
After they had been there for a while, their story came to
be known, for his father was the great mill owner in a
near-by town. When the young man had married the
High School girl instead of the wealthy one whom the
father had chosen for him, there had been a lot of trouble
and the young man had been told to leave home with his
bride and expect no more help from the father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the young man had never worked, so it was very
hard for him, but she also worked and, little by little, they
bought the things needed in the tiny home on the hill,
and they were very happy. Then, one day, a scaffold
fell and they brought the young husband to the little wife
all bruised and bleeding, and that very night a tiny girl
came to the home to live. The neighbors helped all they
could, but in a few days the father of the baby was gone,
and the little girl-wife was left alone to care for the
baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the mill owner heard of the death of the son
and the birth of the little girl, he sent to the mother and
said: &#8216;We will take the little girl and bring it up as our
own if you will give it to us and have no more to do with
it.&#8217; But the brave little woman sent back answer, &#8216;As
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
long as I have a mind with which to think and two hands
with which to work, I can and will support my little girl.
I thank you for your offer, but I love my baby too much
to accept it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was a hard pull. She worked in an office; she
worked on a farm. Then a position was offered her as a
teacher in a Home for Little Children. Here she could
have her own room and keep the baby with her when
she was not teaching. And while she was teaching, it
would be cared for with the rest. Gladly the mother took
the position and for more than a year she was very, very
happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;One night when the baby was nearly three years old,
she sat reading in the parlor of the home when some one
called, &#8216;Fire! Fire! Fire in the left wing!&#8217; Oh! that
was where her baby was, on the very top floor. Like a
bird she flew across the hall where the smoke already was
pouring out. Up the first flight, choking, she went. Up
the second. Then she had to fall to the floor to creep
along. She could see the fire. It was on the fourth floor
where her Mary was. Could she ever reach it? Would
the fire block her way?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten minutes after the call of fire had been given, the
workers saw some one staggering through the lower hall.
In her arms she carried a bundle wrapped tightly in a bed-quilt.
And dangling from her hands was a long string of
beads. Her face was burned. There was no hair on her
head. She was writhing in agony, but she reached the
door, handed the burden to a worker, saying quietly, &#8216;I
am badly burned, but I have saved my two treasures.
Keep them safely for me.&#8217; Then she fell in a heap on the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;For months and months and months she tossed on a
bed of pain. No one thought she could possibly live.
But she did, for she was living for her baby. When at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
last she came from the hospital, her beautiful face was
scarred and red; only in spots had the hair grown; her
hands were stiff and painful, and one leg dragged as she
walked. But she was alive, and that was all she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;While she had been ill, I had gone to see the mill
owner to ask for help for the brave little woman who had
shown us all what a heroine she was. But his answer
had been, &#8216;She took my son from me and I will have
nothing to do with her. If she will give the child to me,
I will bring it up in luxury, but I will not have her here.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So when she was ready to go back to work, I told her
that another offer had come from the grandfather of the
child to adopt it and I said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you feel that
you had better give them the baby?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;For answer, she patted the curly head and said, &#8216;If I
can fight death for my baby, I can conquer in the fight
to live. I shall keep her. You may tell him that the child
will not live in luxury but that she shall know no want,
and she shall have both the education and culture which
befits her father&#8217;s child.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the mother&#8217;s heart was sore when she looked in
the glass and saw what a pitiful change had come to the
pretty face. &#8216;I am so glad it came while Mary was little,&#8217;
she said. &#8216;Had it come later, she would have minded
my ugly face. Now she knows no better and she will
grow used to it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So she was glad when I offered to have her come to
live with us in the distant city where none had known
of her or of the awful fight she was planning to make.
We had taken a large house and there were many things
the mother could do with her stiff hands which gradually,
because of the long hours she spent on them, were
beginning to limber a bit. I gave her rooms for herself
and the child and there she lived, keeping away from all
so that none might see her shrunken, changed body. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
lived only for the child, hoarding carefully the little money
that she could save lest there be not enough to send her
to college when the High School should be over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often have I heard her praying for strength to fight
through the battle; often have I heard her pray that the
little girl should grow to be an honor to the family who
would not help her; often have I begged her to let me tell
the child the story of the days that had gone, but her
answer was always the same, &#8216;No. Let her live the happy,
care-free life. Some day I will tell her, but not now. It
would kill me to have her pity me. She must love me for
myself and not for what I did. My only happiness is to
live and work for her.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the heroine has spent the fifteen years and to my
way of thinking she is a mother of whom you may be
proud.</p>
<p>&#8220;She must never know I have told you. But not for
the world would I have you add to her burden by thinking
she was not all that you wanted your mother to
be.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:6em;'>&#8220;Sincerely,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A. E. Morse.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>When Mary had finished the letter, she sat as one
stunned. Her mind seemed on fire. Mechanically she
picked up the pearls that she had thrown on the bed. Her
mother had carried them with her through that awful fire.
They were one of her two treasures and now she had
almost said she would not wear them. Oh, what a selfish
girl she had been! She had thought only of herself.</p>
<p>Once she had asked her mother why the scar was upon
her face and she had answered, &#8220;Just an accident, child,
when I was a young woman.&#8221; Then she had talked of
something else. The lame foot, the misshapen hands,
the red face, the queer little knot of hair&mdash;all were the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
price paid for her own life. Every minute since she was
born, she had been a burden to her mother.</p>
<p>Now she understood why the little bank account which
she had accidentally found was being so carefully saved.
She had not known that she was to go to college.</p>
<p>Now she remembered that it had been years since
mother had had a new dress, but she had thought it was
because she was queer. There had been many days when
mother had seemed cross&mdash;was it because she was suffering?
Oh, how sorry she was! What could she do to
make her happy now that she knew?</p>
<p>Slowly she undressed for bed. She must be in the
dark to think. When she knelt in prayer, she asked God
to forgive her&mdash;but she remembered that she could not
ask mother to do so. She remembered the words of her
mother to Mr. Morse,</p>
<p>&#8220;It would kill me to have her sorry for me. She must
love me for myself and not for what I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she tossed and tumbled as the time slipped by.
Suddenly she heard a foot dragging across the hall, and
a big lump came into her throat. How often she had
rebelled at that foot! Then her mother came quietly
into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;why are you here? Aren&#8217;t
you asleep yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; said the mother, and the girl thought she
had never heard a more beautiful voice. &#8220;I heard you
tossing in the bed and I thought perhaps you were ill. So
I came to see. What is the trouble, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, to-morrow is my graduation day and I think I
am sorry to leave school,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;I love these
dear little beads which I have under the pillow, mother.
Have you had them long? I never saw them before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many, many years, girlie. Your father gave them
to me and how hard he worked to earn them! I love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
every little bead on the string. But I shall love to see
you wear them for his sake. I saved them for you once
in the long ago because I wanted you to have something
that he had earned for us. And now you must go to
sleep, for you must look bright and pretty to-morrow.
Oh! I shall be so proud of you when you start for the
school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a white arm drew the mother down close to the
bed and a sweet girlish voice said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Be all ready when the carriage comes for me to-morrow,
mother dear, for you are going with me, even
though it is early. No other girl has a mother who has
worked so hard as you have to keep her in school. You
are the best mother in the whole world and I am so proud
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you are as proud of me as I am of you, we
are the happiest little family in the whole world,&#8221; said
the mother, kissing her on both cheeks. And two people
were happy because real love was there.</p>

<h2>THE FIR TREE AND THE WILLOW WAND<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor"><span style='font-size:0.8em'>[B]</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>All this happened years ago when the red men lived
along the lake shores and hunted in the woods. The
Indians still tell the tale and shake their heads sadly,
whether because of the sadness of the story or because
they sigh for the old days, I do not know.</p>
<p>Willow Wand was the daughter of old Chief Seafog.
She was not like the other girls of the tribe. She was
straight and lithe like a willow, and she looked more like
a beautiful boy than she did like an Indian maiden. This
is not strange when you think that she wore the leather
leggins and the short jacket of the Indian boy and carried
a bow and quiver of arrows thrown over her shoulder.
And in spite of the fact that she shot a straighter arrow
than most of the lads about her, they all loved her, for
she would run with them and hunt with them, and at
night, by the fire, she would tell them strange and beautiful
stories. In her face they saw a light that they did
not see in the faces of the other girls and squaws of the
village, for Willow Wand had a secret which made her
full of mysteries.</p>
<p>As Willow Wand grew taller, the time came when
she thought of wedding. Young Fir Tree, the most daring
of the young braves, loved her, and Willow Wand
knew that she loved him. And when Fir Tree went to
old Chief Seafog, Willow Wand went with him, which
made it not difficult for them to receive the old man&#8217;s
blessing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>So on one brilliant day in Indian summer, Fir Tree
and Willow Wand were married. The fallen leaves
danced at their wedding feast and the blue mists of autumn
were the bridal veil. Every one was as happy as
an Indian could be. And in the starlight, Fir Tree took
Willow Wand to his tepee. He brought a great buffalo
robe from the tent and spread it on the hillside, and they
sat down close together and looked up at the stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you, my brave Fir Tree,&#8221; said Willow Wand.</p>
<p>Fir Tree put his arm about her. &#8220;And I love you, my
little Willow Wand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are the most beautiful
woman in the world. I would not have you like the
rest. They are good; they grind the corn; they do the
work, but their faces are like stones. Yours is full of
secrets and lovely memories. What makes you so different,
my love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My secret, Fir Tree. My father says that a woman&#8217;s
secret is her beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a woman must tell her secret to her love,&#8221; and
Fir Tree looked off into the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Willow Wand must not tell her secret even to her
love,&#8221; she said very, very softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot trust me nor love me then, Willow
Wand,&#8221; said Fir Tree, growing stiff and cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you, Fir Tree. I will tell you my secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fir Tree continued to look off in the darkness, but he
bent his head a little so that he might not miss anything
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;One night, long ago, I sat out in the evening like this
with my father. &#8216;Father, I want to shoot your bow, your
smallest bow,&#8217; I said. &#8216;You haven&#8217;t the strength to draw
it, even my smallest bow, little Willow Wand,&#8217; he said.
&#8216;Oh, but I have. I have tried it,&#8217; and I ran into the tent
and brought the little bow with the red bear painted on
it. &#8216;See, I shall shoot that star, the red one there.&#8217; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
pulled the string and the arrow was off. We waited to
hear it fall. &#8216;It takes a long time to reach the stars,&#8217; I
said. Just then there was a splash in the jar by the
tepee door. &#8216;There it is,&#8217; said my father, &#8216;your star has
fallen into the rain jar.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked, and, sure enough, there was the little red
star, lying on the bottom of the crock, and shining so
brightly that we could see it through the water. &#8216;My
star!&#8217; I said. &#8216;We shall always keep it here, my father.
I brought it down with my arrow.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The next day my father took me hunting, and he gave
orders that that jar was never to be moved from beside his
door until I should leave him, and then it was to go with
me. And always he has kept fresh water from the spring
in the jar. See, he has brought it up here beside your
tepee that it would be waiting for me. Yes, my Fir Tree,
see, here is my own star still shining brightly&mdash;more
brightly to-night because of my great happiness with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear little Willow Wand, what a beautiful child you
are,&#8221; said Fir Tree, and he brushed back her black hair
and looked into her eyes. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that the star
in the crock is only a reflection of a real star above your
dear head in the sky? No one can really shoot a star,
Willow Wand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But of course it is a real star, Fir Tree; we heard it
splash as it fell into the jar, my father and I. And I
see it now; it has always been here since that night. You
are mistaken, Fir Tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fir Tree rose and lifted up the jar, and, tipping the
water out, said, &#8220;See, I shall show you that Fir Tree is
never mistaken. I shall empty the crock. See, there is
no star left in the jar, nor has any red star tumbled out
with the water onto the grass. Ah, your secret was very
beautiful, little Willow Wand, but now you know the
truth. The truth, too, is beautiful.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>There was a little moan of anguish, and Willow
Wand disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>The next morning a tall squaw came out of Fir Tree&#8217;s
tepee. She picked up the empty rain jar and with tired
footsteps walked down to the spring for water. She was
dressed in the conventional clothing of her tribe, and her
face was dull and expressionless like the stones on the
path over which she walked. Down the long trail to the
spring she walked. It was very, very early, so the moon
still shone and the little stars twinkled in the sky. Often
she looked at them, longing for her little red star.</p>
<p>Slowly she stooped, filled the jar, and lifted it to place
it on her head when suddenly she stopped, looked&mdash;then
gave a cry of surprise and delight, for there, shining clear
as crystal in the water of the pail, was the little red
star.</p>
<p>Willow Wand set the jar carefully on the ground and
then knelt long beside it. How she loved the little red
star! How happy she was to have it once more beside
her! And as she looked, the tired look left her face and
a smile of joy and peace took its place.</p>
<p>Picking up the jar, she looked once more into the clear
cold water. Then she said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, little star. Come with me to the wigwam of
brave, strong Fir Tree. Together we will make it the
happiest wigwam in the encampment. You shall still help
me to be my best, for I shall still have a star.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
<h2>THE TWO SEARCHERS</h2>
</div>

<p>Peter was tired of doing the same thing over and over
and he wanted a change. Ever since he could remember
he had fished and sold the fish he had caught.
He had made nets and mended them. First he had done
it for his father, and now he owned the boats and nets and
fishing implements. But he stood on that bright summer
day close by the beautiful Lake of Gennesaret in Galilee,
wishing over and over that he could do something that
was more worth while.</p>
<p>There was a reason why Peter was more discouraged
than ever on this morning. He had fished all through the
night before in the hope of getting a good catch so that
he might skip a day&#8217;s work and go to hear the great
teacher about whom men were talking and whom Andrew,
his brother, had seen. But though he had worked hard,
not a fish had he caught. So now he was mending the
holes in the net with a very discontented look on his face.
What was the use of it all, anyway? He twisted the
rope this way and that, showing by the pulls that he
made that his mind was full of trouble.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard Andrew talking to him. &#8220;Peter,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Peter, see the crowd coming over the hilltop.
Perhaps the teacher is coming. I do hope so, for I would
hear more of the words he was telling us yesterday.
Come, let&#8217;s go and meet him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;I must finish this net. What will
he care for us? We are only poor fishermen.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Andrew had not waited to hear his answer&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
had already begun to ascend the hill. How eager he was
to hear another story from the great story-teller!</p>
<p>Peter mended one hole after another, keeping his eye
on the crowd that was coming closer and closer to the
lakeside. Then he heard a kindly voice say, &#8220;Would
you mind letting me take your boat, for the multitude
press upon me and I have many things to say to them.
If I can get away from the shore, they can all hear and
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silently Peter brought the fishing boat to shore. The
Master wanted to use something that he had. After all,
a fishing boat was useful sometimes, even if he were tired
of it. Of course he would be glad to help him. So Jesus,
the teacher, sat in the end of the boat and Peter rowed
him out in front of the crowd. Then Peter sat and listened
and looked.</p>
<p>What a wonderful face the teacher had! Peter had
never seen the like. It was browned by the sun but in
the eyes there was a kindly light that made Peter love
to look at him. When he smiled, somehow Peter felt the
smile go all through him. How gentle his voice was!
What made it so? How eagerly the people were listening,
yet he was only telling them a little story about the love
of his father, God.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had a face like that and a voice like that and
could teach like that,&#8221; thought Peter. &#8220;But I am only a
poor fisherman. Oh dear, I wish I could be worth something.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jesus had finished teaching and had bidden the
people go to their homes. Peter turned to row to the
shore, but Jesus was not ready for that. He had been
teaching the multitude and now he wanted a chance to
talk with Peter and Andrew. So he said to Peter,</p>
<p>&#8220;Launch out into the deep and let us fish for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter thought of the long night of useless toil, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
Jesus had asked him to go. This was a chance to stay
longer with the teacher, so he said to him frankly,</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing.
Nevertheless, at your word, I will let down the net.&#8221;</p>
<p>So together the brothers let down the net and Peter
began to row.</p>
<p>This was a good chance for Jesus to study Peter. How
strong and weatherbeaten he looked! His was a good
honest face, and Jesus saw there determination and
courage and trustworthiness. Jesus was searching for
men who could be trusted to carry in their minds and
lives the most precious thing he had&mdash;his message to the
world&mdash;so as he rowed out into the fishing grounds of
Lake Gennesaret that day, he was searching Peter&#8217;s face.
It would take courage, for some of his followers would
even have to die for him. It would take determination,
for there would be many things against them. Yes, Jesus
liked Peter as he watched him and talked to him. Peter
was one of the men for whom he was searching.</p>
<p>Suddenly the net was full of fishes&mdash;so full that Peter
and Andrew could not manage it. Quickly they called
to their partners, James and John, to come and help them.
And when Peter saw the multitude of fishes that were in
the net, he was overpowered with the greatness of the
man who had helped them. Quickly he fell on his knees
before the Christ and said, &#8220;Depart from me, O Lord,
for I am a sinful man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jesus turned to Peter and with a whole world of
meaning said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter, it is a great multitude of fishes that you have
caught, but you can do greater things than that. You
can do far greater things than catch fish from the water.
If you will come with me, I will teach you how to catch
men and you shall be my worker. I need you, Peter.
Will you come?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>Would he come? Peter, who had been longing to make
his life worth while; Peter, who had been longing to
know what it was that made Jesus so wonderful as he
went among men. Would he go and let Jesus teach him?
Would he be a follower of the Master and go out in the
big world to help win men?</p>
<p>A great happiness filled the mind of Peter and when he
lifted his face to the Christ, the answer to the question of
the Teacher was written on it.</p>
<p>So Jesus found a helper and Peter found a task that
was worth while.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when he had brought his boat to land, he gladly
forsook all and followed Christ.&#8221; So well did he follow
that we read in the Book of Acts that after Peter had
talked to the multitude on the day of Pentecost, there were
added to the church, at one time, three thousand persons
who believed the word that he had spoken to them.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
<h2>WHY ELIZABETH WAS CHOSEN</h2>
</div>

<p>The Triangle Club of Center High School were all
busily engaged in choosing the girls whom they
should invite to go to the house party which Mrs. Warren
was giving them. Mrs. Warren had a cottage on a
lake, fifteen miles from the city, and she had written to
the club saying that she wanted them all to spend a week
with George, her son, there in the camp. And better
still, she was ready to invite any ten girls whom they
might choose. Mrs. Warren was the wife of the minister,
so all the boys knew that the mothers of the girls would
be glad to have them spend a week with her at the dear
little camp in the pines, about which they had heard so
much.</p>
<p>One by one they had chosen the girls, each boy having
a choice, and now all that was left to be done was for
Carl Green, their president, to choose. But Carl was in
an examination, so they must wait for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he will choose Charlotte Morey,&#8221; said one.
&#8220;She is so pretty and Carl has taken her to several dances
this winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; said another. &#8220;He will ask
Helen Keats, for she makes such good marks in school
that he is glad to be seen out with her. She is fine company
and I hope he asks her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he will ask his sister, Jane. Carl is always
thinking of her and if she is at home, he will ask her
first, I am sure,&#8221; said a third.</p>
<p>While they were talking, they saw the boy coming
across the lawn in front of the school. Every boy smiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
and eagerly leaned forward to greet him, for Carl Green
was easily their hero. He could lead in sports of all
kinds, he was cheery and patient, he was a good student
in school&mdash;he was an all-round boy and what he did
was right in the eyes of the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Carl,&#8221; they called. &#8220;Here is a letter from
Mrs. Warren telling us we can invite the girls up for
the house party. Isn&#8217;t she a dear to think of it? We
have chosen part of the girls and here is our list, but
you still have a choice. Of course we know whom you
will choose, but we thought we had better let you write
the name. Come on! Hurry up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carl took the list and looked carefully through it.
Then he said,</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be a fine party, fellows. I like that list. Let
me see. That is the last week in June, so Jane will be
away. I&#8217;m sorry, for I should have liked to have given
her the fun. Well, as long as she can&#8217;t go, I should like
to ask Elizabeth Wyman to go with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>A chorus of boys&#8217; voices sounded as soon as the name
was spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth Wyman! Why do you want her? She
doesn&#8217;t go with our set. She refused to go to the dance
at the beach with us, though the whole club was going.
Said she didn&#8217;t like the movie we were going to see. She
wouldn&#8217;t vote for the Sunday picnic that we wanted.
Oh, Carl, you don&#8217;t want her. She would spoil our fun.
Choose another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carl let the boys talk all they chose and then he said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellows, if you insist, I will choose another, but I
should prefer to take Elizabeth. I&#8217;ll be frank with you,
I&#8217;m going to go with her if she will let me and this would
be a fine opportunity to get to know her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she will let you&mdash;that is a joke. As if any girl
would not let you,&#8221; said John.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Carl, &#8220;I mean what I say. I am going to
be her friend if she will let me. And I&#8217;ll tell you why&mdash;though
I am not sure that she would want me to do it.
Still she told me the story in a very frank way, so I don&#8217;t
think she would mind. At least I hope not. But I want
you to know her in the way I do, for if she is my friend
you will be often with her. After I tell you, you will
understand why I say, &#8216;If she will let me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;It was the night of the snowstorm and I was coming
up the street when I caught up with her. It was very
cold and she was snuggling into a beautiful little neckpiece
of ermine. I am fond of furs and so I said to her,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I like the little ermine that you have about your
neck. It is so simple, yet so beautiful. It is very different
from the large ones that most people wear these
days.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; she said, &#8216;I like it too. Uncle sent it to me this
winter and I love it because of the story he told me about
the little animal whose fur it is.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tell me the story,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she smiled and patted the fur as she said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t
think I could, for it is very personal. It was a message
from Uncle to me, so it means much to me. To you, it
might not mean anything.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I should like to hear it,&#8217; I said. &#8216;Please tell it
to me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; said Elizabeth, &#8216;Uncle seems very queer to
mother because he wants a message to go with every gift,
but I like it. When this came, his letter said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Girlie: I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t like to wear this
bit of ermine. When the ermine is pursued by a larger
animal and it comes to a puddle of mud, it will die before
it will soil its coat. Wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if you
and all the girls who are your friends would be as careful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
of your characters and never, no never, do that which
would soil them?&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;We walked part of a block before we spoke after she
had told me of the gift, and then she said, &#8216;I am sure
that the girls at school sometimes think me very particular
because I will not do some of the things that they do.
Perhaps they are all right for them but I feel that they
would soil my coat, so I do not do them. I am trying to
keep it white and this little bit of ermine helps a lot. Of
course, I like to wear it, but it would be very uncomfortable
if I did not try. I hope you don&#8217;t think me foolish,
now that you know the story of the fur.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>There was silence as Carl finished speaking. Then Carl
Green threw back the long locks from his forehead as
he said,</p>
<p>&#8220;I know a good thing when I see it, fellows, and the
girl who would die rather than soil her character is a
mighty good friend for a boy to have. She is worth asking
to our house party. I&#8217;m thinking she is worth winning
for a friend. Good-by, I am going to ask her before
any of you change the name on your list.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Elizabeth Wyman went to the house party at Mrs.
Warren&#8217;s, and to this day she wonders why the boys
seemed so different from what they had seemed before.
But because she knew no difference, she was sure that it
must have been because she was invited by Carl Green,
the leader of the Triangle Club of Center High School.
But you and I know better.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
<h2>JANIE&#8217;S SCHOOL DAYS</h2>
</div>

<p>Janie was sixteen years old, but she looked as though
she might be only thirteen as she sat on the front
seat of the little schoolhouse far up on the mountainside
of Kentucky. Her black hair was plastered tightly to
her head. Her calico dress was much too long and the
sleeves were much too short. Mother had made it long
so that she might wear it for several years, while the
sleeves were short so that she might have no excuse for
not getting her hands in the dish water. Her bare feet
were very dirty but her face shone from its recent scrubbing.</p>
<p>This was a great day for Janie, for the missionary had
once again come to the schoolhouse. It had been three
years since she was there before, and all that time Janie
had waited for her. So she had hurried with her work
in order that she might sit on the very front seat and
hear every word. Last time she had told much about
the school many miles away and Janie had said over and
over to herself, &#8220;I shall go there; I shall go there.&#8221; But
of course it was foolish to say so, for there wasn&#8217;t any
chance that she ever could go. Why, there were seven
brothers and sisters younger than she, and she had to
work all day long to help to get them enough to eat. She
could never go.</p>
<p>But she listened eagerly as the missionary told of all
that was being done in the little schoolhouses all about
the mountains and of the need of teachers to do the
work.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like best to take a boy or girl from some hamlet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
and let them work with us for several years and then
send them back to their own homes to serve there. I am
wondering if there isn&#8217;t a girl here who would like to be
the teacher here and help to make Round Creek what it
ought to be. If there is such a one, send them to us and
we will do our best. If you will pay $10 a term, we will
do the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janie&#8217;s little body was leaning far forward and her
eyes were big with excitement. She knew a girl that
would like to go. But $10 a term! Why, one dollar
seemed big in their home. So she crept out into the darkness
of the night without saying a word to any one about
her great, big longing. But up in the loft of the log house
she lay long after the rest went to sleep trying to think
of a way. Auntie was coming to stay with them in the
fall. If she could just get the ten dollars by that time,
maybe she could be spared for a term. That would help
a little, anyway.</p>
<p>In the morning she loosened one of the boards of the
woodshed. Beneath it she placed a little tin can, and in
the can she put the five pennies that she owned. It was
berry time and she thought she knew of a way to earn
some money that should be all her own. Near the mill,
there were beautiful pieces of bark. In the woods there
were many rare ferns. She would make some little
baskets like she had made many times for the home, fill
them with ferns and try to sell them when she went into
the town with the berries. It meant getting up at four
instead of five, but she could do that. It meant getting
the ferns when the rest of the children were playing at
lunch time&mdash;but that wasn&#8217;t hard. And after her first
day in town she had fifty cents to put into the cup. Oh,
how rich she felt!</p>
<p>An extra quart of berries here and there, some flowers
sold from her little garden patch on the hill, two little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
kittens sold instead of being drowned&mdash;and so the money
in the cup grew very, very slowly and no one dreamed it
was there. But her dream grew with the contents of the
cup. She could see herself all dressed in a neat dress
going up the hill to the school and the little children following
her and calling her teacher.</p>
<p>But in August, George fell from the hay-mow and for
days he lay there white and still. Mother had done all
she could and there was no money to send for the doctor.
Then it was that a little black-haired girl went out in the
shed and for the first time counted the money in the cup&mdash;one,
two, three, four, five, six, almost seven dollars.
Long she looked at it. Then she went into town to do
the errand for her mother and five of the precious dollars
were counted into the hands of the doctor with the repeated
statement,</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell mother that you happened to be going by and
just stopped, so all she needs to pay you is a dollar, for
she has that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So mother never knew, nor did the sick boy know, of
the sacrifice the girl had made. Auntie came and went,
and because it was winter the money in the cup hardly
increased one bit. Sometimes she was almost discouraged,
but then she would say to herself,</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it took years and years for Abraham Lincoln
to get to the White House. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it takes
twenty years. I am going to get to that schoolhouse. I
will be a teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could crochet and she could embroider, so these
helped a bit. She planted more things in her own garden
and the money from these was her own. So again as the
summer drew to a close, she knew there must be several
dollars in the cup&mdash;but she daren&#8217;t count it, for if it
should be ten and still she couldn&#8217;t go&mdash;oh, that would be
worse than all!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>It was five days before school was to open that there
came a letter from grandmother saying that she was
coming to stay for the winter, and while mother was
happy over this, Janie asked if she might not be spared
to go to school. At first there was a firm &#8220;No&#8221; for an
answer. But she begged so hard to be allowed to go for
only one term that she saw signs of relenting in her
mother&#8217;s face. Then she ran to get the cup&mdash;and in it
was nearly nine dollars.</p>
<p>Where should she get the rest? Mother had none&mdash;yet
she must have it. There was only one way. She could
sell Biddy, her pet hen whom she loved so much. She
would ask her brother to take her in the morning, for
she could never do it herself. So with tears in her eyes,
she patted her pet and put it into a box ready for the
morning. Oh! ten dollars was such a lot of money for
a little girl to get!</p>
<p>It was thirty miles to the school, so she had only one
day to get ready. But she had few clothes and so it was
an easy matter. She put them neatly in a bundle and with
a queer feeling underneath the little red dress, now too
short instead of too long, she started bright and early to
walk the thirty miles to school. Many times she turned
to look back at the little log cabin till it was hidden from
her sight by a turn in the road. Then somehow she felt
very much alone in the world.</p>
<p>On and on she walked till at last, twenty miles from
home, she came to the home of an old neighbor and rested
for the night. It was two in the afternoon of the next
day when she saw in the distance the large brick building
which she knew must be the school. She longed to run
to it but her feet were very sore and her body was very
tired. So she trudged on till she came to the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Miss, I have come to school. I can only stay
one term but I came anyway and here is the money. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
missionary lady said you would do the rest,&#8221; and she
handed her the precious money.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to whom did you write about entering?&#8221; said
the lady kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To nobody. You see I didn&#8217;t know I could come till
Tuesday,&#8221; said Janie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am so sorry,&#8221; said the lady, &#8220;but you see we
have all the girls we can possibly take. So we can&#8217;t have
you this term. Perhaps you could come next term if
you leave your name now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole world seemed to fall from under Janie&#8217;s
feet. She was here, thirty miles from home. She had
all the money&mdash;she had sold dear old Biddy&mdash;yet she
could not stay. Not a word did she answer. She just
stood and stared into space.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very tired for I have walked thirty miles to
get here. May I stay just for to-night?&#8221; she asked, rolling
the ten dollars carefully in her big handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;School doesn&#8217;t open till to-morrow but we will tuck
you in somewhere for to-night. I am so sorry for you,
but we just haven&#8217;t a bit of room after to-morrow. Sit
down on the porch and rest yourself,&#8221; said the lady.</p>
<p>She brought her a glass of milk and then left her
alone with her thoughts. How could she go home?
Perhaps there would never come a time when she could
be spared again. Was there no way in which she could
stay?</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, a little girl in a short red calico
dress went down the steps and along the street, looking
for a doctor&#8217;s sign. When she found it, she rang the
bell and asked for the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, sir,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I thought you might know
some one who wanted a girl to work for them. I want
to go to school this term and I have earned the money
to come. And now that I am here, there is no place for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
me and I must walk the thirty miles back. But I am
willing to work. I will work for nothing if only I can
go to the school in the afternoon. Sir, I just must be a
teacher and I just must stay now and get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor whistled a little tune before he answered.
&#8220;And tell me how you earned the money to come.&#8221; Then
he whistled another tune as she talked. &#8220;Stay here to-night,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I will find out at the school just how
much they will let you come in the afternoons. I am
sure you can find work enough, so don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>And sure enough, he found a place for her and so
she started with the rest on the very first morning. She
was radiantly happy till she heard a boy say,</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the red dress that is coming in! Better loan
her a red handkerchief to piece it down with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she knew that she was different from the rest.
Her shoes were coarse and rough. Her hair looked, oh,
so different. Her hands were red and big. She was
here where she had longed to come but oh, how unhappy
she was! She was almost ready to cry. Instead
she shook her head proudly and said to herself, &#8220;I will
be a teacher. What do I care if they laugh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lessons were very hard, for her preparation was
not good; every minute that she could spare she must
spend on getting ready for the next day, so she had
little time to be lonely. But she still minded the fact
that her clothes were so very different. Many a good
cry she had in the quiet of her little room as she looked
at the red dress laid out for the coming day.</p>
<p>The term sped by and she was making good. Oh, if
she could only stay! But she had no money except the
little that the good doctor had given her now and then
for doing errands for him. She could take her books
home and perhaps she could do it all by herself.</p>
<p>So she waited till almost the last day before she told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
the woman for whom she worked that she was leaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, girlie,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;you have much more
than ten dollars coming from me. I have never paid you
because the doctor told me you would ask for it if you
needed it. I will give it to you and then you can go and
pay your ten dollars. I wouldn&#8217;t have you go home
for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clasping her precious money in her hand, she flew up
the stairs. Here was a letter from her brother also.
What a happy day! Eagerly she opened it and read,</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother is counting on your coming home for we
need your help badly. The cow has died and we are
without milk till we can get another. Mother thinks she
must spare you at home and let you work out to earn
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh! Oh! She was needed! She must take the
money she had earned to help to buy a cow and again
she must forget school. So she went again to her mistress,
told her story and began to prepare for the long
walk. She went to the school, borrowed the books, and
promised them she would surely come again. Then she
went again to the old doctor who had been so kind to
her.</p>
<p>He listened thoughtfully as she told him of her new
plans which still had not changed her vision of being a
teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come back, even though it be after four or five
years. I will come,&#8221; she said, and she rose to go.</p>
<p>Then the doctor turned to his desk and took from it
the picture of a girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my little girl,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She, too, wanted
to be a teacher and she was in this very school when
sickness and death came. When you came to me that
first morning and said, &#8216;I just must be a teacher,&#8217; I could
hear her say to me, &#8216;Help her.&#8217; So I did what you asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
me to do&mdash;got you a place to work for nothing though
I knew you were to be paid. I have watched you work,
I have watched you suffer because of the red dress; I
have watched you try to do your duty at the sacrifice of
yourself. And now that you have done all that you can,
I am ready to do the rest. Send the money that you have
earned to your mother to help to buy the cow. Come
to live here and be my office girl. The money that you
earn can go to your mother for I will do for you what
I would have done for her and I will do it for her sake
and because you have shown me that you are worth
while. You <i>shall</i> be a teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Janie lived in the home of her new friend. There
was help on her lessons, the old red dress went back to
the little home in the hills to be worn by some one whom
it would fit and in her new, pretty things she could see
more plainly&mdash;Janie, the teacher.</p>

<h2>SELF-MADE MEN</h2>
</div>

<p>The banqueting hall of Hotel Northland was crowded
to its limit. There were noted men and women from
all walks of life. There were many from humble homes.
There were those whose beautiful dresses showed that
money meant little to them; there were others to whom
the price of the banquet ticket had meant sacrifice. It
was a merry company that awaited the coming of the
guests of the evening.</p>
<p>Cheer after cheer arose when the tall, fine-looking
young man took his seat near the center of the guest&#8217;s
table. He was the newly elected mayor of the city&mdash;the
youngest mayor they had ever had. He had risen
from the ranks and many of the humbler folk knew
him well as a boy. Oh, how proud they were of him!</p>
<p>Then again the cheers sounded as an old white-haired
lady entered and was placed at the left of the mayor.
She it was who had given them their college, their library,
their playground. For years and years she had
been living away from the town, but still she loved them
all and gave of her wealth to make them happy. Her
friends were many in the great banqueting hall.</p>
<p>The supper was served and the tables cleared and
then the mayor rose to speak. He told of his boyhood,
of his struggles at school and college, of his eagerness
to enter the political field, of his happiness at his recent
election.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that every man is master of his own fate.
I believe in being a self-made man and I mean during
these next years when I am to serve you to make it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
possible for every boy to push his way to a career. One
can make himself what he will if only he has grit and
courage. I am here to serve you all,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Not once during the address had the eyes of the little,
white-haired lady been taken from the speaker. She
seemed studying him rather than his address. So intent
was she that she hardly heard the toastmaster introducing
her as the friend whom all delighted to honor.
Dreamily she arose and said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Years and years ago, in this very town there lived a
teacher who had ten bright, happy girls in a club. For
four years they had played and worked together and they
loved each other dearly. Then the husband of the
teacher was taken ill and it became necessary for the
teacher to go to another continent to live.</p>
<p>&#8220;How hard it was for the girls to have her go! But
it was harder still for her, for she had wanted to help them
through to womanhood. She had tried to help them to
see the best but often she had felt that her efforts were
all too small. The day came nearer for her to leave and
she had asked the girls to spend the last evening with
her in her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they came, each bringing in their hands a little
letter, sealed tightly. They were steamer letters for their
teacher and they had been written because they had
heard her say that she wished she could take with her
some idea as to what the girls wanted to be when they
had grown, so that she might be thinking of their plans,
even though she could not be there to help with them.
One by one they laid them on the table till there were
ten little letters&mdash;heart-to-heart letters to their dear
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five days later, away out in mid-ocean, the teacher
opened the letters and read them over and over to herself.
How much they told of the girls!</p>
<p>&#8220;Jennie wanted to be a great singer; she wanted to go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
to New York and study and then go into Grand Opera.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katherine wanted to be a Kindergarten teacher. Ah!
she had found that because of helping in the church.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary wanted to be a lawyer&mdash;a criminal lawyer.
Perhaps that desire had grown in their debating club.</p>
<p>&#8220;Louise wanted to be a nurse. What a dear faithful
girl she had been in helping with the bandages after the
great fire in the city!</p>
<p>&#8220;So one by one she read their letters and her heart was
filled with gratitude that to her it had been given to mold
in a little way their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then turning to the mayor of the city, the little white-haired
lady said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, the contents of one of those letters will be of
interest to you more than to the rest. I was the teacher
of those girls, so I can give you the exact wording of the
last letter that I read,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dear friend: You have asked us to give you our
dearest wish. I have many wishes for the future but
the wish that I want most of all is to be a fine woman
and some day to be a real mother, the kind you have so
often told us about.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl who wrote that letter, sir, became your
mother. Fourteen years before you were born, your
character was being formed, your ideals were being
molded, your future was being safeguarded. I congratulate
you, sir, on being elected to the office of mayor;
but I congratulate you more for being the child of my
little girl of the long ago who at sixteen could write, &#8216;I
want most of all to be a fine, noble woman and some
day to be a real mother.&#8217; To her you owe much. Inspire
the girls of the town if you plan for great men. A self-made
man needs a real mother to build the foundations
of his character. There is no other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the speaker sat down and there was silence in
the banqueting hall.</p>

<h2>ON THE ROAD TO WOMANHOOD</h2>
</div>

<p>In their hands the girls carried a scroll; on their backs
they carried a bundle, and they were five in number&mdash;five
girls with rosy cheeks and healthy bodies. But now
their cheeks were browned by the sun and their shoulders
drooped as they walked by the way.</p>
<p>For they had walked and walked and walked as the
morning had turned into noon, and now the afternoon
shadows were already falling on the way. Then as the
search seemed almost useless, they saw her&mdash;the one
for whom they had come; the one into whose hands they
wished to place their scrolls. Eagerly they watched her
as she came slowly toward them dressed in shining white&mdash;the
Angel Who Rights Things.</p>
<p>When she smiled, they found courage to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have come to search for you but we thought we
should never find you,&#8221; said the oldest of the girls.
&#8220;We can never grow strong and beautiful if we carry
these heavy burdens on our backs. They are much too
large for us and we do not like them. We have come
to ask you to take them away and make us free. Lo!
we have written it all here in our scrolls.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Fairy Who Rights Things drew back as the
five handed to her the scrolls which they carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take away the burdens!&#8221; said she. &#8220;Oh, no, I could
never do that. He that carrieth no burden gaineth no
strength. All must carry if they would grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we do not like them. If we must have a burden,
might we not exchange them? Surely all our friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
do not have burdens to carry. We have watched them
and we know they have none,&#8221; said another girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite mistaken,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;All have
burdens to carry. But I can let you choose if you will
exchange your own. Let me see what you have brought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the first. &#8220;Here is mine. I have to go
to school. Now father has plenty of money and I shall
never have to work. Why should I study and do all the
hard work of the school? I hate it all and I want to
be free from it. I want to live at home and read, and
play, and do as I like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is mine,&#8221; said the second, lifting it from
her back. &#8220;I have to go to church every Sunday when
I want to sleep. There is nothing there for me and I am
so tired of it. But father and mother insist that I go,
at least in the morning. I want to be free from the
church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the third. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind school and I don&#8217;t
mind going to church but I do mind having to help at
home. It is iron and sweep and wash dishes; then wash
dishes and sweep and iron. Always something to do
when I am in the house. I hate housework and I want
to be free from doing it. Mother says all girls should
help at home. But it is a big burden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My burden is quite different from the others,&#8221; said
the fourth. &#8220;I cannot dress as I choose. I must wear
heavy clothes and low heels. I must dress my hair as
if I were old and tidy. All the girls do differently and
I want to be like them. Really my burden makes me
very unhappy. Please let me change it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the fairy turned to the last girl, who had been
resting her burden against a stone wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you here, dear?&#8221; she said kindly. &#8220;Your
burden seems weighing you down. Let me help you
open it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear,&#8221; said the girl, and the big tears welled up
in her eyes. &#8220;This is my home life. Nobody seems to
understand me. They scold and fret and fuss all the
time. Mother is cross and the children are always bothering
me. I want to go away from home and work for
my living and then board as the other girls do. I should
love to have a little room in a boarding-house where
the girls could come to see me. My burden grows heavier
and heavier and I am also very unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, well,&#8221; said the Fairy Who Rights Things.
&#8220;It looks as if I had a big task. All of you seem to be
unhappy, but then we are usually unhappy because we
look at ourselves instead of others. Let&#8217;s try what
these magic spectacles can do. They will show you the
burdens some of your friends carry and also show you
how they carry them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she fitted a pair to the eyes of each girl and they
looked at the passers-by.</p>
<p>There was Kate, who was always smiling and happy.
Her burden was almost as large as she. There was a
sick mother away back on the little farm in the country.
Kate was trying to support her and still have enough to
keep her own expenses paid. Her days were full of
work. In her room, she was sewing to make extra money.
She was very lonely, for she loved the little mother and
longed to be with her, but she must earn money. Oh!
what a pile of worries she had on every side! How
could she ever carry them? But beneath the pile as it
rested on her back they saw a little lever that was lifting
all the time&mdash;and the lever was <i>Love</i>.</p>
<p>And here was May. They had money and automobiles
and everything to make her happy. She had never
seemed to have any burden but now she was carrying a
very large one. She wanted to go to college, she wanted
to make her life worth while, but her parents wanted her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
to stay at home and play the hours away. They would
not let her go and as the months went by she longed
more and more to study and serve. Did she have a
lever to help carry hers? Indeed she did. It was right
under the burden and it was called <i>Vision</i>.</p>
<p>Then there was Tom, the baseball star. He too carried
a burden. They had never known that he had a
father. But he carried the burden of a father who drank
and drank. Oh, what a shame to take him through the
streets in such a helpless condition! Did Tom have a
lever? All looked eagerly to see and they saw <i>Ideals</i>&mdash;he
would have a spotless character and retrieve the
family name.</p>
<p>And there was Helen. Her people used profane language
and she loved the pure. They loved the world
and she loved the ideals of the church. They made fun
of her faith and tried to change it. How heavily she
was loaded, yet they had never dreamed of it when they
had seen her teaching her little class in the Church School.
But <i>Belief in God</i> was helping her to carry her load.</p>
<p>So they passed along the way before the five girls.
All were carrying something but not all were carrying
their load alike. Some smiled, and some sang as they
staggered beneath a heavy load; others groaned and
fretted with the weight of a much lighter one. Some
were not only carrying their own load but helping to
carry others.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the Angel Who Rights Things, &#8220;do
you see a load that you would prefer? If so, then I will
ask the bearer to exchange with you. Will you choose
by the size of the burden or the ease with which it is
carried?&#8221;</p>
<p>But though they searched long and diligently, they
found no load easier than their own.</p>
<p>At last one turned to the Angel and said, &#8220;We find no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
one to choose. And since we must carry a burden, will
you tell us how best we may carry these?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the face of the Angel lighted with pleasure till
it glowed like the sun. &#8220;When one asks <i>how</i> to carry
and not <i>why</i> he must carry, already the load is lighter,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;If you will, your school can give to you
a vision that will make your load seem very easy; your
church can give to you a love that will make you eager
to go there and learn to serve; your home cares can give
you ideals for your own little home some day; your
mother can show you how to grow into beautiful womanhood
if you will but give her a chance; your troubles
at home can give to you a sympathy that will not only
lift your own burden but help with those of others. All
these levers that you have seen helping to lift loads have
been right at your hand to help you if you would only
have given them an opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How shall you bear your burdens? With a smile
on your face, and love in your heart, and any <i>lifter</i> that
you can find.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the Angel Who Rights Things went on her way
to find others who groaned beneath their burdens because
they had never learned how to carry them.</p>

<a name='HER_PRAYER' id='HER_PRAYER'></a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
<h2>HER PRAYER</h2>
</div>

<p>Every time the King automobile went past the little
home of Julia Lowe when Julia was there, she ran
eagerly to look into the face of the lady who sat inside.
She had such beautiful clothes; she sat so tall and stately;
she had such a wonderful smile. She was Julia Lowe&#8217;s
ideal woman.</p>
<p>Julia had gone with two other girls to ask Mrs. King
to help them with their Liberty Loans and she had not
only taken bonds but had given them flowers from the
great garden back of the house, and had invited them
to come again. Every time she saw her go by, Julia
wished she, too, might have such a sweet face and such
a heap of good things as Mrs. King had.</p>
<p>Now Julia worked in an office downtown, so, of
course she thought she had to act and to do as the other
girls in the office did. When they wore their hair very
straight, hers was straight also; but when they wore puffs,
she had to get up much earlier in the morning to force
her pretty hair into great puffs over her ears. Mother
wanted her to wear serge dresses in the office, but the
other girls wore georgette waists, so of course she had
to wear them also. Some of the girls in the neighborhood
liked to go to the library to read, so they had
formed a club for that purpose and had asked Julia to
join. But the girls in the office liked to go to dances
and picture shows, and so she must go to them also&mdash;else
how could she talk things over with them at the noon
hour, and tell them of the boys she had been with, and
the places where she had gone? Oh, yes, she just must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
do as the girls in the office did. But in spite of it all, she
wasn&#8217;t very happy and sometimes she wished she could
run away from it all and just go back to school again as
her mother had wanted her to do.</p>
<p>When she looked at Mrs. King, somehow her beautiful
face seemed to make her want more than ever to
do better. What was there about her that made Julia
love her at a distance and yet be afraid of her when she
came near her? Julia didn&#8217;t know. But she did know
that deep in her heart she wanted to be like her and
didn&#8217;t know how. If only she had money and beautiful
things, perhaps it would be different.</p>
<p>One day when the leaves were very beautiful in their
fall colors, a dainty little note was left by the postman
for Julia and it read,</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Julia</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know you but I am going to ask a great
favor of you. Mr. King has been called out of town and
he is not willing to have me stay in the house all alone,
for it is very big and lonely since Mary died. I wish
very much that you would let me call for you at the
office this afternoon. Then we will go out in the country
to see the beautiful colors and have our supper at the
Country Club. Then, when we come home in the moonlight,
I should like to have you spend the night with me
here. I shall hope that you can come.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Sincerely,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Margaret L. King</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Julia was so happy as she read it that she could hardly
contain herself&mdash;to go for a ride in the wonderful car;
to eat at the Country Club; to sleep at the home of Mrs.
King&mdash;why, she had never even dared to dream of such
a thing. It was too good to be true.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>Of course she must look her very best, so she asked for
an extra half hour at noon. She would wear her new
thin waist with the very low neck, for the girls had told
her that she looked &#8220;too sweet for anything&#8221; in that.
Her silk skirt was shabby but it would never do to wear
her serge, even if it were new, when she rode with Mrs.
King. As she put on the high-heeled slippers, she noticed
that they were much run over, but they would have
to do. It took her a long, long time to fix her hair just as
she wanted to have it, for one dip must just touch the next
at the right angle.</p>
<p>Finally all was ready but the extra touches to her
face. There was the rouge for which she had spent so
much money. The boss at the office had told them that
they would lose their job if they came with it on their
faces again but she must risk it this once. A little penciling
of the eyebrows, a little powder here and there,
and Julia felt very sure as she looked at herself in the
glass that she would &#8220;do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her shoes needed brushing but she hadn&#8217;t time for
them, for, even now, she had only time to run as fast
as she could to get the car which would bring her to
the office in time. There was a button off her coat which
she had forgotten, but the coat needn&#8217;t be worn; her
fingernails needed attention, but she never cared much
about them. As long as her face, and her hair, and her
clothes were all in style, she was all right to go anywhere.</p>
<p>Promptly at five, the King car came to the door of the
factory and Julia stepped in, followed by the envious
glances of her friends in the office. What a ride it was
through the open country! Miles and miles of beauty
such as Julia had never seen. Mrs. King found so
many interesting things for her to see that all the restraint
wore away, and she found herself talking to her
friend and telling her all about her own life and pleasures.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>Then Mrs. King told her a little about what she did
with her time and, to her surprise, Julia found that Mrs.
King was a very busy woman. Over and over as they
talked, Julia noticed how soft and sweet Mrs. King&#8217;s
voice was and how carefully she used the best of English.
And again, Julia found herself wishing she were like
Mrs. King. Somehow she did not care to use the slang
words that seemed so necessary when she talked with
the girls.</p>
<p>When their coats were removed at the Country Club,
Julia found that Mrs. King was very simply dressed in
a dark blue serge dress with little white collar and cuffs.
Many other girls and women in the group were dressed
in the same way. Then Julia became suddenly conscious
of the run-over heels and the torn skirt, for she and
Mrs. King were in the center of the room, and she was
being introduced as &#8220;My friend Julia.&#8221; How she did
wish she had taken mother&#8217;s advice and worn the new,
pretty serge!</p>
<p>In one of the corners of the dining-room there was a
little table for two that overlooked the lake, and towards
this Mrs. King made her way. Here they could see every
one and yet be quite alone. Then Mrs. King told her a
little of the people in the room. Here was the wife of a
noted judge; that was the High School teacher of whom
she must have heard the girls speak if they had ever
been to that school.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who are these two girls in front of us?&#8221; asked
Julia. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the dark-haired one a beauty? Evidently
the young man with her thinks so, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mrs. King&#8217;s face grew quiet as she said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are two girls of whom we are very fond here,
but I am so sorry to see Jessie doing as she is. No,
Julia, she is not pretty. She has painted her face and
all her natural beauty is hidden. Usually she is very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
attractive. Her friend&#8217;s face is sweet and clean. Evidently
she does not care to attract attention to herself by
the use of paint and rouge. She believes in being true
to her best self even though she is not in the height of
style. When you have lived longer, you will know, dear,
the truth of what I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor Julia. Her face burned like fire. Mrs. King had
said &#8220;My friend Julia,&#8221; yet she, too, had paint on her face&mdash;not
red like the girl in front, to be sure, but it was
there. Why had no one told her before? All the girls
did it and she thought it was the thing to do. Then there
came to her an impulse to ask Mrs. King about it, so she
said frankly,</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. King, I have some paint on my face, too, but I
put it on because I was coming out with you. I thought
you would like to have me look my very best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do, girlie,&#8221; said Mrs. King, putting her hand
on the hand of the girl opposite her. &#8220;Indeed I do want
you to look your best. I have liked you ever since I
came to Hillcrest to live and it has hurt me to see you
trying to do as all the other girls did. I have wished so
often that you would be a leader in doing the finer things
and help others to see what real beauty is and how to get
it. Real beauty is not put on from the outside; it grows
from within.&#8221;</p>
<p>Julia looked at Mrs. King&#8217;s sweet, loving face very
hard for a minute and then said,</p>
<p>&#8220;I have liked you, too, and I have watched you go
back and forth, wishing I could be like you. Will you
show me how? Mother has tried but I thought she did
not know. No one else has ever tried to tell me about
your kind of beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they made the compact. Then they sat and
watched for well-dressed women; for women in whose
faces there was strength of character and purpose; for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
girls whose very manner showed they were ladies; for
men who honored the girls in whose company they were.
Such fun as it was! Julia never knew the time to go so
fast. It was so plain now that clothes did not necessarily
make the lady. She was almost sorry when it came time
to go home.</p>
<p>In the house, a great fire was burning and it looked so
cozy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have looked into your windows many times as I
have passed and wished I could sit before the fire and
dream and dream,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;May I sit down here
for a while?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will both sit here,&#8221; said Mrs. King, &#8220;then I will
tell you about my little girl who used to sit here with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>How Julia&#8217;s heart ached for her friend as she told her
of her love for her own dear girl, of the plans they had
made, of the sudden sickness and death, and of the loneliness
of the big house since she had gone! She had
thought Mrs. King had everything to make her happy,
yet the thing she wanted most she could not have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her hair was much like yours and sometimes, as you
have passed, I have wished I could comb yours as I did
hers. Would you mind if I did?&#8221; said the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should love to have you,&#8221; said Julia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, when the fire has died out, we will go up
to her room. In the drawer there I have a little white
dress that perhaps you would like. I will comb your
hair just as I did hers and see if the dress will fit you,&#8221;
said Mrs. King. &#8220;If you look sweet and girlish in it, I
will give it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Mrs. King slipped away to get the things needed
for the hairdressing, Julia went to the great white bathroom,
and when she came out her face was sweet and
clean and every trace of the paint and powder was gone.
Her pretty brown hair was down her back in ringlets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and her face wore a look which the girls at the office had
never seen there.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. King brushed, and brushed, and brushed till
the hair was soft and shiny. Low in her neck she coiled
it, making it look girlish and neat, fastening it with a
tiny velvet circlet. Then Julia held her breath as Mrs.
King took from a drawer a little white dress. It was a
simple silk mull but it was prettily made. Below it was
a dainty petticoat and at the bottom of the drawer were
white oxfords and fine, lisle stockings.</p>
<p>&#8220;These were ready for her graduation, dear, but she
never wore them once after they were made,&#8221; said the
mother softly, as she fingered the dress lovingly.</p>
<p>There were tears in the eyes of the mother and tears
in the eyes of the girl as the dress was put on. And when
Julia looked into the mirror she seemed to see a strange
girl. How little she looked like the girls in the office!
But she liked her hair&mdash;and she liked the looks of her
face&mdash;and she loved the simple, white dress.</p>
<p>Last of all Mrs. King slipped about her neck a little
string of pearls. &#8220;These are my gift to you, Julia,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Wear them when you think you are dressed as
you and I have planned to-night and be as beautiful as
the pearls. Remember, dear, we may put beautiful things
on the outside but they can never make us beautiful. It
comes from the inside because of what we are. It stands
the test of study. It is always real. A girl who does
not live up to the best she knows can well be called a
coward. Good night, dear, I am glad there is a girlie
who loves me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then with a good-night kiss she was gone&mdash;gone, as
Julia knew, to be more than ever lonely for her own
little girl.</p>
<p>For a long time Julia stood looking at the dress, and
the slippers, and the stockings. Mrs. King had plenty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
of money, yet these were to have been her daughter&#8217;s
graduation clothes. And she had not finished school
because she could not have clothes like the rest of the
girls who were to have expensive ones. Mrs. King was
honored all through the city, yet she was dressed in a
simple serge dress at the Country Club. It was all very
strange! Some one had things very much mixed up
concerning what a girl should wear. How long it
seemed since she had left the office in the afternoon!</p>
<p>The room was so dainty that it took Julia a long time
to get ready for bed. How she would love to have a
room like this! Maybe it would be easy to be good. She
looked at the dress again, as she laid it carefully over
the chair. It was all hers. The girls would laugh at
her but she loved it. Then she lifted the little string of
pearls&mdash;not cheap, big ones such as she had worn on
Sunday, but dainty, beautiful ones, and they whispered
again to her,</p>
<p>&#8220;Be as beautiful as the beads, girlie. True beauty is
never put on from the outside. It comes from inside
because of what you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long she stood in the moonlight near the window looking
at them. Then she dropped on her knees and said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear God, she has shown me the best. Help me
not to be a coward as I go out and try to do it. Help
me to be as beautiful as the pearls. I thank Thee for
to-day. I want to show others what real beauty is and
how to get it. Please help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Father heard the prayer of the girl kneeling
there in her white night-gown, for it came from a sincere
heart&mdash;and He answered.

<h2>THE BEST DAY</h2>
</div>

<div class='ce' style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-bottom:2em;'>
<p><i>By</i> <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Mrs. Annie G. Freeman</span></p>
</div>

<p>One sunny summer afternoon Margaret sat reading
beneath the shade of an old apple tree. Before her
stretched a charming view but on her face was a troubled,
dissatisfied look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;Even this book is stupid.
It is the dullest, most stupid day that I ever saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stupid day?&#8221; said a tiny voice. There on the rock
before her sat the daintiest little golden-haired fairy
that she had ever seen. The fairy&#8217;s feet were resting on
a woodbine vine that was creeping up the wall, and her
wings were as delicate as those of a butterfly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes such a bright day as this stupid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose it is myself,&#8221; said the discontented
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;Now I will take you
with me to the Palace of Time and you shall choose a day
that suits you better. Come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over green meadows, through pleasant pastures, beside
babbling brooks that sparkled and played in the sunshine,
the fairy led. At last they came to the Palace of
Time. The fairy led the way up the long hall to the
throne on which Time sat, and told her errand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the little friend to the Hall of Days,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and give her the day that pleases her best.&#8221;</p>
<p>How delighted the maiden was! Wouldn&#8217;t you be if
a fairy should take you out of a stupid day and promise
you the day that pleased you most? She just skipped
along, her feet scarcely touching the ground in her joy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
In a great room filled with all kinds of bright lights, they
stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Hall of Days,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;Take
whichever day pleases you most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like great balls of glass the days were of many colors
and of many kinds. Some were dark and some were
light; some were dim and others clear.</p>
<p>One was like a crystal and the odor of roses seemed
to come from it. Its colors were soft and Margaret
gazed deep into it. Vague dreams seemed to come from
it and memories happy and delightful. But she couldn&#8217;t
live on dreams and memories. That wouldn&#8217;t do. She
might like that sort of a day once in a while but her
young life demanded something to do on the best day.
This was a day that had gone.</p>
<p>One other day pleased her much. It shone like the
sun on the new fallen snow. It was so white and so
pure that she lifted it carefully lest she should soil and
spot it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bright. It hurts my eyes,&#8221; said she, putting
it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, little girl,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;That is to-morrow.
It must be shaded by many things before one can bear
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, just between the two, Margaret spied the most
beautiful ball of all. It wavered and shimmered; now it
was red, now green, now yellow and now pink. Oh, there
were so many colors that she could not name them all.
Wave upon wave of color swept through it and all seemed
shot with the golden lights.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the one that I want,&#8221; she cried happily. &#8220;That
is the most beautiful day of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it, then,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;It is yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the way home, the maiden clasped it tightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this day,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can be joyful. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
this day I can make so many people happy, and it is so
bright that I can see the best way in which to go. It is
as light as a feather. I can hardly wait to show my
friends the beautiful day that I have chosen, for I love
it dearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said the fairy, as she flew off in a different
direction. &#8220;It is a wonderful day. Infinite wisdom
and love helped you to choose aright. That is
To-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a beautiful day!&#8221; said the maiden as she sat in
the shade of the old apple tree. &#8220;I believe I have been
dreaming. But this is too beautiful a day to idle it away.
I will go and do something for some one to make others
see its beauty also.&#8221;</p>

<h2>IN THE WAY</h2>
</div>

<p>Gladys Mercer sat looking at a snapshot which
had come to her from one of her girl friends. It
showed a strong, athletic woman with a blanket rolled
over her back hiking along the road and with her six
girls in middies and bloomers. And as Gladys looked at
the picture, she smiled at the memories which it brought.</p>
<p>There was the long hike, the tired muscles, the view
from the mountaintop, the wonderful sunset, the stillness
of the night and the fear of the dark. Then there was
the voice of the woman in the picture,</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, you are safer here than in any house you could
find. Just remember that God is over all and sleep as
sound as can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was the sunrise, the pancake breakfast on
the hill, and the hike home. Best of all there had been
two long days with Mrs. Fuller, the friend of girls.
What a good visit they had had with her! What a fine
story she had told them at the sunset! What a helpful
prayer she had made as they closed their good-night song
when the sun went down!</p>
<p>And then from the thought of the trip, Gladys went
to the thought of all that Mrs. Fuller had meant to her.
She was sunny; she was happy in her work through the
day, and happy to give her time to them at night; she
was always ready to advise and help; she seemed to know
just what to do when they did not know; somehow she
could always get them to do the thing they had thought
they would not do. She was to Gladys, the motherless
girl, a friend, a companion, a leader and a heroine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>What was there about her that made her able to lead?
Was it her smile? Was it her ability to do things? What
made a leader anyway?</p>
<p>Gladys leaned far back against the old tree under
which she had been sitting and said to herself, &#8220;I wish&mdash;I
wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you wish,&#8221; said a little voice, and there
close to her was a dear little lady dressed in red and in
her hand she carried a lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; said Gladys.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the Fairy of Helpful Service,&#8221; said the little
lady. &#8220;I heard you talking about one of my helpers, so
I was interested to know what you wished when you
thought of all she had done for you girls. Now tell me.
What do you wish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are a fairy, perhaps you can give me my wish.
I wish to be like Mrs. Fuller. I want to help girls. I
want to get the kind of letters she gets from girls who are
far away. I want to see &#8216;my girls&#8217; some day giving service
all over the world as she does. I want to be like
her. Please, fairy, give me my wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make you like her but I can put you in the
way of service and then, if you choose, you can become
like her and get the things you are asking for. Those
things are not given&mdash;they are earned, and the cost of
them is heavy. I don&#8217;t really think you mean what you
say, for you haven&#8217;t even wanted to go to school to learn
to help. Perhaps the best way would be to let you see
<i>her</i> in the way and then you can choose for yourself
whether you want your gift. Come and we will watch
her climb the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the Fairy of Helpful Service and the girl who
wanted to be a leader went together into the House of
the Past.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said the fairy, &#8220;there is Mrs. Fuller as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
little girl. We will watch her grow and you may see
where she earned some of the qualities which you admire
in her.&#8221;</p>
<p>There she was, a mischievous little girl of ten, as happy
as the day was long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here she is laying the foundation for health,&#8221; said
the fairy, &#8220;with long hours of sleep and good food and
plenty of play. One begins away back in girlhood to be
a leader. Some who would have been good helpers for
me cannot serve because they did not begin early enough
to get ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then as the little girl played there came into the way
a black, black cloud. Gladys shuddered as it came nearer
and nearer to the little girl and finally enveloped her.
It was death&mdash;the death of her father, but after the cloud
had passed and the sunshine had come again, the fairy
said,</p>
<p>&#8220;See, her shoulders are broader. She has learned
what loneliness means.&#8221;</p>
<p>On she went and then she was going to High School.
Others had clothes that she did not have. She must
hurry to finish because there was no father in the home.
So, eagerly she pushed through the High School.</p>
<p>Just here Gladys saw a hand reached out to help and
heard a voice saying to the girl, &#8220;Of course it will be
hard but you can go to college if you really want to go.
It will do you good to sacrifice for it.&#8221; &#8217;Twas the Master
of the school who was helping her to keep in the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you see her grow?&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;She has
added concentration, an appreciation of the girl who has
little and who must be with girls who have much, and
now she has been given a vision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Gladys watched her toil through college, earning
her way, often overtired and worried as to where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
means to go on were to come from. But she pushed
ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Gladys, &#8220;how hard she works! I could
never do that. I am sorry for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;You need never
be sorry for those that sacrifice for an ideal. Be sorry
for those who have none and so who live at ease.&#8221; And
they watched her struggle through temptation and toil
to the graduation day.</p>
<p>As the college days passed, there came strength of
purpose, but there came also the desire to serve. Gladys
watched her lead the little group of dirty street boys in
the slums.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can she do it?&#8221; said Gladys. &#8220;They are so
dirty and so rough.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the fairy said, &#8220;When one wants to serve, she
looks at the heart and the life&mdash;not at the clothes and the
actions. The boys are helping her to keep in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>And after college there were happy days. Days of love
and comradeship, days of work for the fairy; days when
opportunity was everywhere. And in these days of happiness
there came lessons of sharing, of winning, of filling
the life with sunshine. The path was so bright that
it dazzled.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Gladys looked ahead in the path. &#8220;Look,&#8221;
she said to the fairy. &#8220;Look, oh, how black it is! Oh,
I am sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the storm descended and all was black in the way&mdash;oh,
so black and to move took all of one&#8217;s strength.
Against it she struggled, but it seemed as though she must
surely be driven from the path. Death and loneliness and
worries seemed overpowering.</p>
<p>But the storm passed and, when once again there was
peace, a great strength had come in its place, for there
was sympathy for others who suffered, there was an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
appreciation of the value of friendship, and there was a
knowledge that God helps.</p>
<p>Little by little the road widened, though often it was
lonely and hard. There were many steep places but each
added something. And then Gladys saw the picture
change.</p>
<p>There was Mrs. Fuller with her girls and she was
leading them by the hand. But it was by no means easy.
Some held back; some chose to play by the way; some
looked longingly at the things by the wayside that would
harm. But her one hand reached up and her other hand
helped them ahead as she tried to keep them in the way.</p>
<p>As the picture faded, Gladys turned to the fairy. &#8220;I
thought it had been all sunshine but now I see how hard
it has been to learn to understand and to help. I love
her better than I did before, now that I have seen her
in the way. Thank you, fairy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But wait,&#8221; said the fairy. &#8220;You asked me for a gift.
Do you still want it? Do you still want to follow her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To follow means study, and sacrifice, and temptations
conquered, and sympathy, and all sorts of hard things,
doesn&#8217;t it? I never thought about it. But I love Mrs.
Fuller and I still want to lead girls&mdash;I still want the
letters and I still want to be like her. Please, Fairy of
Good Works, put me in the way and I will go back to
school and begin to get ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the little lady smiled as she waved her wand over
the head of the girl. &#8220;Your life may be much more
sunny than hers, dear. Not all must have the same
things to overcome. But whatever you meet in the way,
you must struggle against it and come out stronger because
you have struggled. Can you see away off there
in the distance the hands of girls&mdash;oh, so many of them&mdash;eagerly
reached out for help? They are &#8216;your girls.&#8217;
And here is the way. Above there is one who helps and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
I am here though you may not see me. Push forward
or the girls will have no helper. Good-by and good luck
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as Gladys reached out to detain her, her hat fell
to the ground and she found herself sitting against the
tree. In her hand was the picture of Mrs. Fuller and her
girls. Long she looked at the picture. Then she said
to herself,</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew the way was so long or so hard to be
like you but if just one girl can love me some day as I
love you, then I shall be glad I have walked in the way.
I am ready to try and I hope I can win.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
<h2>AN OLD, OLD STORY</h2>
</div>

<p>It was a dark and rainy day when about the inn-fire,
close to the great caravan way that led through Canaan,
in the land of Palestine, a group of camel-drivers
and travelers were gathered. They looked very different
from what they do to-day, for nearly four thousand years
have passed since then. But they were all huddled together
listening to stories and songs.</p>
<p>In the group there were men from Egypt; there were
men from Babylon, the great city far to the East; there
were men from the land of Canaan; and then there were
some wandering nomads who had lately come from the
East and so were called by the Canaanites &#8220;Hebrews,&#8221;
which means, &#8220;People from the Other Side.&#8221; Most of
these men were shepherds, but they loved to meet with the
camel-drivers and learn of the customs and habits of
the people of other lands. &#8217;Twas a strange group of men
sitting about the little fire.</p>
<p>In those days, as now, men loved to tell stories that
had come down to them from their fathers and grandfathers,
and often they found that a story from Egypt
was but little different from one that had been told in
Babylonia. So they loved to listen to the story-tellers.</p>
<p>But on this day it had rained and rained till the streams
were full and the way was very hard to go. Thus there
were very many men in the inn. &#8217;Twas the turn of the
Babylonian, so he began,</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you one of the very oldest of our stories&mdash;about
a great rain-storm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Years and years and years ago the Gods in heaven
began to fear that the men of the earth were going to live
forever and so they made a plan by which to destroy
them. There should be a great rain for days and days
and days, and all these men and women and children
should be drowned. Then the Gods would be free from
their worries.</p>
<p>&#8220;But one of the Gods named Ea had a friend who lived
on the earth, and so he sent word to him to go with all
his family into a big, big ship and take with him two of
every kind of animals. Utnapishtim, the friend, did as
he was told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the rain came and for six days and nights there
was no let-up at all. Deeper and deeper it grew till the
Gods in heaven grew afraid and cowered in the highest
corner of heaven. By this time every living thing, except
the ones in the big ship, was destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But after six days, the rain ceased. Then the man
sent out a dove, but it returned, for it could find no place
to rest. Later he sent out a raven and it did not come
back, so he knew the waters were going down. Then he
made a great sacrifice to the Gods and they came, they
saw the great destruction and they gloated over it, pleased
that their plan had worked so well.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>There was applause when he had finished from many
of the group, but the Hebrews did not applaud. They
had been taught that there was one true God, not many
Gods. They had been taught that God was kind to all
and not one that gloated over destruction of men. They
were not pleased with the story of the great flood.</p>
<p>Then there came nights out under the stars and they
heard the stories of how the earth was made; of how man
came to be; of the meaning of many of the things that
they saw all about them. But in every story there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
found Gods who were cruel, who were unkind, who quarreled
and fought. There were many, many Gods, but
none was like unto their God.</p>
<p>As the old Hebrews listened to all these old, old stories
from the countries about them which were told so often,
they shook their heads sadly and said,</p>
<p>&#8220;We have come into this country to live and bring up
our children. But if they hear these stories, they will believe
some of them and forget the true God. They must
have stories of their own that show how great and mighty
is the God of Israel. But what shall we do about these stories?
If we say the stories are false, they will laugh at us
and say, &#8216;Why, our people have known these stories since
long, long before there was a Hebrew on the earth.
What our fathers have told us as true is surely true.&#8217;
And if we say to our children, &#8216;You must not listen to
these stories,&#8217; they will be all the more eager to listen.
What shall we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally it was decided that the stories of the Egyptians
and the Babylonians must be remade so as to be fit for
their children to hear and they must teach the beliefs
of their own religion in stories of their own.</p>
<p>So, many weeks later as the men were gathered out
under the stars on a beautiful night, one of the best of the
Hebrew story-tellers said quietly,</p>
<p>&#8220;I have listened to stories about the making of the
world from many of you but I think my story is better
than any you have told. Would you like to hear the story
of how the God of Israel made the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a Hebrew who is talking,&#8221; said one. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know you people had any stories. Give it to us. Then
we can compare it with our own great stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Hebrew story-teller began:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
earth. And these are the generations of the heavens
and the earth when they were created in the day that
the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,</p>
<p>&#8220;And every plant of the field before it was in the
earth and every herb of the field before it grew; for the
Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and
there was not a man to till the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there went up a mist from the earth and watered
the whole face of the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Lord God formed man out of the dust of
the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of
life; and man became a living soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow
every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food;
the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Lord God took the man and put him in the
Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</p>
<p>&#8220;And out of the ground the Lord God made every
beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought
them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and
whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was
the name thereof.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>There was silence when the story was finished. This
God of whom the Hebrew was telling was wise and
mighty enough to make the world, yet he was thoughtful
and kind. He allowed man to be a helper. There was
only one God. They liked the story so well that they
began to tell it also and soon the beautiful story was
known all through the land of Canaan. Little by little
it drove out the other stories and became the most loved
one.</p>
<p>And when the old Hebrews saw the power of the story
that told of the <i>one</i> great God rather than the many false
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Gods, they just took many of the old stories and made
them good and wholesome for their own little children
to hear.</p>
<p>So great were the stories that the old Hebrews told
that you will find many of them living still. You can
read them in your own Bible in the book of Genesis.</p>
<p>Ever since that day years and years ago, men have
been asking that same old question, &#8220;Who made the
world?&#8221; The greatest men of science and history have
tried to answer it, but none of them have found a more
beautiful answer to the question than this one which the
old sheik told in the days of the long ago and which you
will find in the second chapter of Genesis in your Bible.</p>

<h2>HIS DEBT</h2>
</div>

<p>It was a hot, sultry day in that little town near the
Western coast of Africa when Afa Bibo came. He had
had a long, long journey from his home among the Ntum
people far to the south of Efulen. So he, as well as the
men who had brought him, was glad when they saw
the rude little hospital looming up at the end of the path.</p>
<p>Years and years before, when Afa Bibo was just a
little baby, his mother and father, because they were
superstitious and ignorant, had deliberately infected the
little one with yaws, one of the most loathsome of African
diseases. Little by little the disease had spread
through his system till now, a boy in his teens, he was
gradually losing his sight. So they had brought him to
the white doctor who had done so much for boys and
girls in the neighborhood, to see if he could also help
Afa Bibo.</p>
<p>It took only a glance at the one eye to know that the
sight was gone forever. But there was a chance that the
other might be saved. To be sure, the inflammation was
there and much damage had been done, but still there was
a chance. So they put him under the care of the nurse
and began the fight that was to tell whether he was to
be one of the many African blind ones who suffer so
much and help so little, or whether he was to be like
other boys.</p>
<p>It was a long, hard time for the little fellow. The eyes
must be washed with a solution that was very painful;
he must spend long hours not only lying in bed but with
all light shut from his eye. He grew very weary with it
all. But after the months had gone, Afa Bibo went out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
of that hospital with an eye as clean and white in the
ball as yours or mine.</p>
<p>Of course, he was anxious to go back to his people
and tell them what wonderful things had been done for
him, but the Doctor said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Afa, you can do much with your one good eye, but
if you will stay right here and go to school with the boys
for a time, you can do much, much more. You can be as
good as one man, two men, and perhaps as much as
three. If you will stay, you can be a big man in your
own tribe. It may be you could be a teacher and tell
the boys there how to read and write or it might be&mdash;yes,
it might be&mdash;you could be a doctor and make other
boys to see, just as we have done to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Afa Bibo stayed in the mission school and learned
to study, and to work, and to think. For a time he felt
badly to think he had only one eye when all his companions
had two, but little by little he seemed to have forgotten
it.</p>
<p>Then came the day when the Christian people of that
little African church were to pledge a definite number of
days of service in carrying the message of the Christ to
others. Some were to go out and teach; some were to
carry Testaments and tracts written in Bulu to others;
some were to help about the mission station so that there
might be a better place in which to teach the ones who
came. Some were to raise extra crops so they might
have something to give to those who went far out to teach.
Every one could give something, even though it was very
different from what another gave.</p>
<p>As it neared the time for the service, the black people
might be seen coming from all directions. Some had
walked five miles, some ten, and some even twenty. All
had something to eat so that they might stay to hear all
the good news that could be given in a day. They filled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the little bare building which the boys of the school had
builded for a church; they filled the window spaces; then
they filled the yard about the church. Oh! there were
very many of them and all were eager for the service
to begin.</p>
<p>Holding the roof of the little church were large poles
which had been painted white and on these the pledges
were to be made. So as the service began, many looked
at the poles and thought what a wonderful thing it was
to be allowed to give of themselves to the God who had
become their own.</p>
<p>Soon the pledging began. First to go was the old
chief who had given up his twenty wives that he might
become a Christian. He was old. What would he give?
First he made a slanting line and then he crossed it. Ah!
that was ten days of service.</p>
<p>Then others were ready, and some gave ten days, some
one or two weeks, and some could even give a month.
The lines covered one pole and then another as the people
passed down the aisle and out of the building.</p>
<p>Last of all came the boys of the school. How could
they give? They were only boys. But they could take
of their play time till they had gained a day or more
to give. One marked after another and last of all it was
the turn of Afa Bibo.</p>
<p>Very near to him stood the kind doctor who had made
him free from the pain and able to see the way as he
came to the white pole. So he smiled one of his rare
smiles as he passed him. Then he made a slanting line
and crossed it; another and crossed it. That was twenty
days. No boy had given as much as that. But he was
making another&mdash;twenty-five days. And he crossed the
third. Then with his shoulders square and resolve in his
face he went out with the rest.</p>
<p>As the missionaries sat before their home on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
following day, they saw Afa Bibo coming across the yard
to them. Calling the doctor aside, he said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor, I am not satisfied with what I pledged yesterday.
I want to give more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Afa,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;already you have pledged
thirty days. That is a great deal for a boy to give. A
pledge to God from you must be as binding as His promise
is to us. Work out the thirty days and then come
back and give Him more if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am not happy about it,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;I want
to give more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you had better leave it just as it is, for I am
sure you do not know how long thirty days will be when
you begin to give it all. Run along and do your lessons.
I think you have given much to God,&#8221; said the Doctor.</p>
<p>Then Afa slowly came very near to the doctor. Looking
up into his face, he pulled down the lower lid of the
good eye showing it to be white and free from all soreness
and pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do you see that good eye? Well,
God saved me that eye and I have more to be thankful
for than any one else in all that big churchful yesterday.
I owe him more than thirty days. Please, sir, I want to
pay back a little of what I owe him. Let me make it
thirty-five.&#8221;</p>
<p>So together the doctor, who had given his life for God,
and the little black boy, who was just beginning to give,
went to the church and put another black mark on the
tall white pole. And Afa Bibo went out to work his
thirty-five days for God.</p>
<p>Were you to go among the Ntum people to-day, you
would find there a man who is beloved by all because he
has loved to give of himself to his people. He has a
kindly face and a loving heart. It is Afa Bibo, the boy
who is still eager to pay for his one good eye.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
<h2>HOW KAGIGEGABO BECAME A BRAVE</h2>
</div>

<p>Kagigegabo sat in front of the wigwam watching
the fire slowly die out. Her heart was full of bitterness.
For days she had watched the Braves get ready
for the long chase. They had painted their faces; they
had given their war cries; they had fasted and prayed.</p>
<p>And now they had gone and the camp seemed very still.
Oh! how she had wanted to go! Why was she born a girl
when she did want to be a Brave! Girls could never do
brave things&mdash;they had to stay at home, and tend the fires,
and hoe the garden. Everything a girl had to do, she
hated. Everything a boy had to do, she liked. Her name
was Kagigegabo, which meant &#8220;One who stands forever.&#8221;
That would be a great name for a Brave, but she could
never do anything that was worth while. She was only a
girl.</p>
<p>Slowly she rose to bring the corn and grind it. There
was little needed, for the Braves of the wigwam had all
gone&mdash;even Guka, her brother, had gone. Before this she
had watched the others go and then had had him to cheer
her. Oh, dear! Why was she a girl?</p>
<p>Hearing a step behind her, she rose to find Wicostu, the
oldest squaw of the tribe, waiting to speak with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard your thought,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You think
that to be a girl is to be less than a Brave. It is not so.
It is not so. To be a squaw one must be very brave.
We cannot go to hunt and to kill, but it takes no less of
courage to stay here and guard the tepees. It takes courage
to bear pain&mdash;it takes courage to be tired and not
complain. You can be brave, Kagigegabo, even though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
you must grow into a Mahala and sit by the fire. The
courage is not in the war paint and feathers&mdash;the courage
is all in the heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kagigegabo sat very still after Wicostu had left her.
Over and over she said to herself those last words of the
old squaw&mdash;&#8220;The courage is all in the heart.&#8221; Perhaps
after all she could be a Brave, such as Guka was trying
to be.</p>
<p>Down toward the spring she ran to get the water for
the meal when, suddenly, a hand reached out of the bushes,
and she was drawn into them. When she tried to scream,
a heavy band was placed over her mouth, and then her
hands were tied, her eyes were bandaged and she felt
herself being thrown on a pony. Oh! how fast they went!&mdash;like
the wind it seemed.</p>
<p>Who had taken her? Where was she going? What
did they want? Frightened as she was, she still was
trying to think.</p>
<p>Then, like a flash, there came to her something that she
had heard the old chief say when she had been trying
to get closer to the council fire the last night.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall go by the hill trail, for Eagle&#8217;s Claw will
surely have spies about the camp. We cannot get through
the valley alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps she had been taken by the spies and was on
her way to the enemy camp of Eagle&#8217;s Claw. Oh! What
did they want? If only she were a Brave, perhaps she
would know what to do. Then there came to her the
words of Wicostu:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can be brave. The courage is all in the heart.&#8221;
But to be brave when one did not know what was going
to happen&mdash;oh! that was hard.</p>
<p>When the bandage was taken from her eyes, she was
in the center of a circle of old Braves. Very fierce they
looked as she glanced about the circle. Her knees shook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
till it seemed she must fall. Then she made a low bow
to the chief and pointed to her feet&mdash;a sign that she was
ready to be his slave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that knife?&#8221; he screamed at her. &#8220;You
shall die unless you tell us by what path and to what place
your Braves went to-day. Speak!&#8221;</p>
<p>What should she do? If she told, the men would die.
If she kept silence, she must die. Her hands trembled.
Then she remembered again the words of Wicostu,
&#8220;Courage is all in the heart,&#8221; and smiling at the chief
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Kagigegabo will lead you. She knows not the name,
but the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a long time they counseled. Should they go? At
last five of the Braves were ready. They mounted her
on a pony. Then they came to her with a great bow
and some poisoned arrows and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you try to escape, these are for you. If you lead
us wrong, these are for you. If you lead us right, you
shall have this young Brave,&#8221; and they led forth one of
the strong, young Braves of the tribe. &#8220;Go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of the encampment went the six horses. Where
should she go? She must lead in the way of the hill.
But how could she? Once she climbed a tree to get a look
out and so gained a little time. Once she led them where
the rock dropped sheer and bare, and again she gained
time. But nearer and nearer to the meeting place she
came.</p>
<p>Suddenly low at her feet she saw a tiny, white flower.
It was the one used by her mother to make the sweet
drink that would make one sleep, and sleep, and sleep.
But if too much was taken, it meant death. A daring
plan came to her mind. Dare she do it? Dare she eat
of it? Mother brewed it&mdash;she must eat it as it was. They
were still several hours from where she knew her father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
was to be found. If her plan succeeded, she could save
him.</p>
<p>Reaching down, she dug her feet into the sides of the
little pony. Immediately his heels went high in the air
and she lay flat on the ground.</p>
<p>Quickly she gathered much of the little white flower
and pushed it into her dress. Then when the men came,
she was lying with broken ankle on the ground. The pain
was intense, but the happiness that they must stop was
sweet to the girl. Over and over and over she said to herself,
&#8220;Courage is all in the heart. I can be a Brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took some of the little white flower and began to
eat of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said the men. &#8220;What do you eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I eat the sweet flower of this little plant. If you eat
of this, you shall not thirst,&#8221; said the girl.</p>
<p>Now they had ridden far and hard and the day was very
warm, so when the men heard this, they bent and gathered
bits of the plant. It was sweet and pleasing to the taste,
so they ate more and more of it. And the Indian girl
watched them and smiled when none could see.</p>
<p>It was decided to get the evening meal while the oldest
chief bound the ankle of the girl. So they hurriedly
cooked it. But before it was ready, the leader leaned
against the old tree and he was asleep. Then another and
another slept. Stronger than opium had been the flower
that they had eaten.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Kagigegabo watched them while her own eyes began to
droop. She must not go to sleep. Oh! what could she
do? She must ride when they were asleep. What could
she do? She turned and twisted the broken ankle. That
helped a bit, for the pain was intense. She pulled great
locks of her hair and tied them about her fingers so that
the blood would have to force its way about. And after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
what seemed to her to be hours, she was still awake and
the five men were all sleeping.</p>
<p>Slowly, very slowly, she pulled herself away from the
fire out into the bush where her pony was tied. Her feet
seemed determined not to move and she wanted so much
to lie down and sleep. But she kept on till she had led
the pony away from the group. Then she mounted and
started on her ride.</p>
<p>But it was no use. She could not stay awake. Now
what was she to do? They were on the direct road to the
valley. For a moment she hesitated. Then quickly she
tore her dress in strips. Taking a sharp stone, she cut
her arm and with the blood she made two pictures on a
piece of wood&mdash;the one showed five Indians asleep&mdash;the
other showed an Indian girl by the road. Taking the
strips from her dress, she fastened the bit of wood to the
saddle.</p>
<p>She took from her arm the circle of brass which would
tell her father from whom the message had come, and
fastened it to the saddle. Then a cut of the whip across
the legs sent the pony flying down the path.</p>
<p>After he had gone, the girl sat in a dazed way near the
path. She was so tired. If only they would hurry, then
she could tell them which way to go&mdash;but sleep came
before the pony had gone even one mile.</p>
<p>Five days later, Kagigegabo opened her eyes slowly
and looked about. She was lying on the skins in the wigwam
of her mother. Her ankle was tightly bound and
she felt very stiff and sore. Across her wrist there was
an ugly cut. No one was about so she lay there trying
to remember what had happened. How long had she been
there and where was her mother?</p>
<p>A step sounded outside and an old war chief&mdash;her
father&mdash;looked anxiously into the tent. When he saw her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
eyes open, he came slowly in and gazed long at the Indian
girl on the bed and then went as slowly out again.</p>
<p>When he came back, there were with him five other
chiefs. Around the bed they stood in a silent circle and
Kagigegabo wondered what they were going to do with
her. Had she done wrong? Was she to be punished?</p>
<p>But the old chief spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Kagigegabo, you have saved the tribe from ruin, and
because of your help, we have captured the enemy, for
whom we were searching. They have told us of your
bravery and of your wisdom. You were more full of
courage than any squaw we have ever known. You shall
no longer be called Kagigegabo, but you shall be called
Aotonaka, the daring one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then upon the arm of the girl who had wished she
could be a Brave they bound a red band&mdash;the red band of
courage.

<h2>THE WHITE FLOWER OF HAPPINESS</h2>
</div>

<div class='ce' style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-bottom:2em;'>
<p><i>By</i> <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Persis Richardson</span></p>
</div>

<p>The King sat in the library of the palace reading an
old, old book&mdash;a book written when the King&#8217;s
great-great-grandfather sat on the throne. The King had
never seen the book before and it was very interesting to
him. For the book told of a strange little plant that had
grown in the kingdom in those days of the old, old
king.</p>
<p>No matter how hard the people had to work, if the little
plant was growing in their homes, they were happy.
Indeed, the book said that the flower of the plant was so
beautiful that no garden was complete without it; so in
the days of the long ago, it grew in the gardens of the rich
and the poor, while happiness and prosperity reigned in
the land.</p>
<p>Eagerly the king read the description of the little flower
that grew on this wonderful plant. It was white as the
driven snow. It had heart-shaped petals surrounding a
wonderful heart of gold, and it was known as the White
Flower of Happiness.</p>
<p>Now the King loved flowers dearly and there were
many in his garden; but he was sure he had never seen
this little flower. So, because he wanted to have one for
his very own and especially because he wanted happiness
and prosperity for his people, he determined to find it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely somewhere in the kingdom there must be a
plant left if it grew so common in the days of my great-great-grandfather,&#8221;
said the King.</p>
<p>Then calling the heralds to him he said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ride forth and search. Go East, and West, and
North, and South, and say to my people, &#8216;Search for the
White Flower of Happiness, and when you have found it,
bring it to me that I may raise more seeds so that all may
have a chance to own it. &#8216;Tis a little flower, white as
the driven snow, with petals that are heart-shaped around
a heart of gold.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagerly the people, both rich and poor, went to work,
for they knew of the wondrous beauty of the flower and
wished it for their own.</p>
<p>Now there were two people who were very sure they
would be first to find the flower. One was a rich woman
who loved beautiful things. Her home was the largest of
any on the finest street in the royal city. She had many
and large gardens, cared for by the best gardeners to be
found. Yet in the summer-time, when they were glowing
with hundreds of flowers, few there were who could enjoy
them. A high hedge surrounded them all and only her
friends were permitted to go through the iron entrance
gate.</p>
<p>This wealthy woman said to herself: &#8220;I will find the
flower and it will be easy to keep it secret from all others
if I have it here behind the hedge. Then I shall be sure
of happiness in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>So all of her gardeners were set to work to search for
the White Flower of Happiness. Wherever they found
a plant of rare beauty, they bought it hoping that it might
be the plant she sought. Seeds of all kinds also were
planted. And in the blossoming time there were flowers
in the gardens by the thousands&mdash;but behind that great
wall there was no flower that was white as the driven
snow, with heart-shaped petals surrounding a heart of
gold.</p>
<p>There was also a man in the kingdom who thought he
could surely find the flower. He was a business man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I could find it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I would grow more plants
and sell them to the people at a great profit. Then I
should quickly grow rich and there would be no need for
me to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he set his office force all to work to write letters to
the gardeners and seed-growers of the world. They described
the little flower and offered large sums for one single
plant. But he, too, failed in his search. It was not
to be found.</p>
<p>Down in the heart of the poorer section of the royal
city there lived a little old lady whom every one called
Aunt Betsy. She was very poor; she had only one room
that she could call home, and her only companion was a
scrawny cat that every one else had driven away. But it
loved her and she loved it, and was glad to have it share
her home.</p>
<p>She was very lame and had to hobble away to her work
every morning, yet she was the cheeriest little body alive
and every one loved her.</p>
<p>Aunt Betsy, like all of her neighbors, was seeking the
White Flower of Happiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;This old street with its tumble-down houses, and uneven
sidewalks, and tin cans surely needs a heap of something
to cheer it,&#8221; she would say. &#8220;Now, if I could find
just one plant, I would make this old alley the finest
place ever. Then the little children here could have some
chance. I wish I might find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But no flowers grew where she lived or where she
worked, so she couldn&#8217;t hope to find the plant. The only
thing she could do was to save every penny she could so
that, if the King found the plant, she might possibly buy a
seed.</p>
<p>Into an old tin cup she put the pennies, one by one, but
it was very slow work, for Aunt Betsy was very poor.</p>
<p>One winter night as Aunt Betsy returned from work,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
she found a queer looking bundle on her door-step and,
on unrolling it, she found Bobby, one of the neighbor&#8217;s
children. Now Bobby had no mother and only a poor
drunken father, who often beat him. And Aunt Betsy
saw, as she unrolled him, that his face was all tear-stained,
so she knew what had been happening. Bobby
had crept away from the blows to come to his best friend
when in trouble&mdash;Aunt Betsy.</p>
<p>Carefully she picked the little fellow up, carried him
into her bare little room, gave him a hot drink, and then
tucked him all comfortably on the couch which served as
her bed. Tired from his day of play and work, the little
fellow was soon lost in sleep.</p>
<p>Not so Aunt Betsy. Sitting by the fire, all she could
see were the great holes in the shoes she was drying.
Bobby needed some shoes very badly, but she had no
money with which to buy some.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the money in the cup,&#8221; said a voice within.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t give that, for I want so much to buy a
seed to bring happiness to this alley,&#8221; thought Aunt
Betsy.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a pair of shoes would bring happiness to Bobbie
now,&#8221; said the voice.</p>
<p>She looked again at the little swollen feet under the
cover on the couch. Then slowly, yet with a smile of
infinite tenderness, she softly stole to the cupboard, took
the money from the little tin cup, drew on her old shawl,
and went out into the night.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a very happy Bobbie who went back to his home
in the morning, and behind Aunt Betsy&#8217;s stove were the
little worn shoes. A little later a little old woman went
down the narrow stairs to her work and she sang as she
went.</p>
<p>That night Aunt Betsy, hurrying past a florist&#8217;s shop,
bumped into a barrel of waste that stood on the walk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Stopping abruptly, she saw a wilted-looking plant in an
old broken pot on the top of the pile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you poor little plant,&#8221; said Aunt Betsy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
just take you home and love you; perhaps you will grow
for me in my little upper room.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she carried it home, transplanted it into the old tin
cup from which she had taken the money, and then set it
where the sunshine would find it the very first thing in the
morning.</p>
<p>In two days the plant showed signs of life. In a week
it stood tall and firm. In two weeks there was a bud
which Aunt Betsy watched with great care. Would it be
pink or red or yellow? She didn&#8217;t care if only it were a
blossom.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas night when she came home from her work, but
as soon as she opened the door she knew that the little
flower had opened, for the room was full of the fragrance
that it was sending forth. She hurried to the window and
she saw&mdash;oh, could she believe her eyes! She saw a little
flower, white as the driven snow. Its petals were heart-shaped
and surrounded a heart of wonderful gold. It was
the White Flower of Happiness.</p>
<p>During the night, the little plant stayed with her in the
attic room, but in the morning she carried it to the palace
and gave it to the King. Thus, through a simple loving
old woman, the White Flower of Happiness was given to
a whole kingdom.</p>
<p>But the strange thing about the plant was this: Whenever
its owner kept the flower only for self and did not
share it with others, it withered and died; but, when
lovingly shared, it grew and blossomed and made happy,
not only its owner, but all to whom it went. It was in
very truth to all&mdash;The White Flower of Happiness.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
<h2>THE SPEAKING PICTURE</h2>
</div>

<p>There had been a great discussion in the High School
all the week, and as Friday drew nearer the excitement
grew more and more intense. For Barton High
School had many girls from the Hill section of the town
where the mill owners lived, and also many girls from the
River section where the mill workers lived.</p>
<p>There was to be an election for the president of the
Senior Class and when the names of the candidates for the
presidency had been posted on the bulletin board by the
nominating committee, a mill girl headed the list.</p>
<p>Such a thing had never been heard of in the school.
Always the president of the class had been the one who could
entertain the class, who could stand out prominently during
class week, whose father would help to pay the bills of
the Commencement time.</p>
<p>But at the beginning of the year, the class had decided
to learn to do things according to parliamentary law and
to be democratic, and this was the result. Never for a
moment had the girls and boys of the Hill section dreamed
that a committee would dare to choose a River-section
president.</p>
<p>To be sure, the girl whom they had chosen had led the
class both in marks and in the debating club. Yes, she
could make a splendid Commencement Day speaker, but
she was a River-section girl, and they just wouldn&#8217;t
have it.</p>
<p>So they argued and pleaded and tried to persuade their
friends to make her fail the election. Why, there would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
be no fun at all during Commencement week if she led
the class. She had nothing at all to spend for fun.</p>
<p>Chief among the objectors had been Mary Waite.
Her father owned the largest mill and she had thought
surely the place was to be hers. She had even planned
how she would entertain the class on the lawn of her
home. She was ready to do almost anything to upset the
plans of the nominating committee.</p>
<p>So the group of girls were still scolding when they
reached the door of the museum about four o&#8217;clock on
Thursday afternoon. Mary had an errand in the picture
gallery and the rest were to wait for her in the corridor
below.</p>
<p>As she entered the gallery, she pulled from her book
the assignment which had been given to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Study the pictures in Gallery Nine and bring the name
and the artist of the picture that speaks most plainly to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>What an assignment! How could any picture speak to
her when she was feeling in such an unpleasant mood.
She passed down one side and then along the end of the
gallery. She liked the children in this and the flowers in
that. But surely none would speak to her.</p>
<p>Down another side she went, stopping more often to
look at the things that interested her.</p>
<p>Suddenly she saw a picture of the Christ. It was at
the end of the gallery, and a wonderful light was thrown
on it from a globe just above the picture. The Christ was
standing in a room and in his face was such a tender,
thoughtful look.</p>
<p>Mary sat down in the seat nearest to her. She did not
want to move nearer lest she lose the rare expression of
the face of the Christ. It had only been a few weeks since
she had been standing before the altar of the church,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
making herself a gift to the Christ. So as she sat and watched
the picture, she thought to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;What a wonderful man he was! I should have loved
to have had him look in my face as he is looking into
theirs. I wish I might have really seen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a time she moved nearer. Then she could see the
faces of the other persons in the picture. From where
she had been sitting, only the face of the Christ had
seemed to stand out, though one knew the others were
there. They were sitting about the table in a home.</p>
<p>What a rude table it was! How roughly they were
dressed! Why, they were only poor people, yet the Christ
was standing in their midst, giving them to eat.</p>
<p>She studied his face. How beautiful it was! How
much she loved him! How eager she was to give him her
very best! What could she do to show her love? And
as she looked she heard a voice saying to her: &#8220;The
poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then somehow the faces of the men in the picture
seemed like those of the men who worked in her father&#8217;s
mill and in the face of the woman she saw a likeness
to Elizabeth Meeker. But the face of the Christ was still
full of love and tenderness.</p>
<p>The head of the girl drooped as she sat long before the
picture. What had she against Elizabeth Meeker? Nothing
except the fact that she was poor. She was a girl
that Jesus would have loved, for she was always dependable.
Yet Mary was trying to take away the greatest
pleasure that might ever come to that poor girl.</p>
<p>She had no pretty home, she had little time for play;
she hadn&#8217;t even a mother. Yet Mary knew she had been
very, very unkind to her.</p>
<p>And now the face of the Christ seemed searching her
very soul: &#8220;The poor ye have always with you, but me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
ye have not always. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
one of the least of these, ye have done it unto me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sound of a bell and Mary knew she must
leave the room. One last look she gave to the Christ of
the picture. Then she smiled and nodded her head.</p>
<p>When she came to join the girls below, she said quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, let&#8217;s give the school a surprise to-morrow. Let&#8217;s
go and vote for Elizabeth Meeker, since so many of the
class want her for president, and then prove to the rest
that we can still have a good time during Commencement
week. Father will let us use the grounds when we like
and we can all have a part in the planning of the fun. I
should just like to see if she really can make a class
president as well as we girls from the Hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>And though the girls couldn&#8217;t understand why she had
changed, yet they were glad to follow her lead.</p>
<p>That night Mary Waite sat before her desk in her pretty
room on the Hill and looked again at the assignment
which had been given to her&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Study the pictures in Gallery Nine and bring to me
the name of the picture and the artist who painted the
one that speaks most plainly to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in no uncertain letters she wrote:</p>

<h2>THE QUEST</h2>
</div>

<p>Once there came to the land of the Every-day a messenger
from the King. In his hand he carried
glasses to help him in the search which he was making.
Under his arm he was carrying a scroll. On his face
there was a look of deep concern.</p>
<p>How could he ever find the most beautiful thing in all
the world? There were so many beautiful things that
he had no idea even where to begin. Yet this was his
commission: &#8220;Of all the beautiful things, choose for me
the most beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the messenger called for heralds and sent them
forth to ask of the people of the Every-day their help in
choosing for the King.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring to me your most beautiful thing,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Then I will choose from these things what I deem most
beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>And one brought a wonderful gem. It was clear as
crystal; it sparkled in the light and seemed to beg to be
chosen. The rays of the noonday sun shone through
the stone and all the people cried with one voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;How beautiful! How wonderful! We have never
seen the like!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; thought the messenger, &#8220;I shall never find
anything so rare as this. I will take it to the King.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a voice cried: &#8220;Wait, oh, messenger, wait! That
which is dead can never be the most beautiful thing.
Surely I have here that which far exceeds the stone which
you have seen. I beg you look at this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>Then he opened the cover of the great box that he
carried.</p>
<p>In a bed of shimmering white there lay a beautiful
rose. Its leaves were still wet with the dew of the garden.
Its petals were as perfect as perfect could be. Then
as the sun shone into the box, the exquisite rose caught
also the rays of the sun and slowly the beautiful petals
began to unfold.</p>
<p>There was silence in the group of people about the
box. What a wonderful thing the man had brought to
the messenger! It had beauty, but it had also life.</p>
<p>Yet even as they looked there came another. By his
side walked a great dog. His hair was like silk; his eyes
were tender as a child&#8217;s; his face was as knowing as a
person&#8217;s. Quietly his owner brought him forward, saying:
&#8220;This is to me far more beautiful than the rose.
This has beauty and life, but it has also usefulness. It
has saved the lives of many.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he patted the head of the faithful animal.</p>
<p>Then a mother pressed through the crowd and said:
&#8220;Surely no animal is so beautiful as a child. See! here
is my little one. She has beauty and life and usefulness&mdash;and
she has also the magic beauty of innocence. See
her hands, and her little feet, and her golden curls. I
am sure there is no more beautiful thing in all the world
than my baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the messenger sighed. What could he do? He
just could not find the thing that the King had asked him
to find. All were so beautiful. Thinking to be by himself,
he walked away. Into a path alone by himself he
went.</p>
<p>Then he heard voices, and, brushing aside the branches,
he saw a young maiden who played with a little child.
Her touch was very tender as she played the childish
game. And when they had finished, the messenger held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
his breath, for the child had thrown a tiny arm about
her neck and the yellow curls of the baby were close to
the brown ones of the maiden. And the maiden&#8217;s face
was wreathed in a wondrous smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is beauty,&#8221; said the messenger. &#8220;That is rare
beauty. But why is she so beautiful? I must see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quickly he unfastened the glasses from their case and
turned them to the picture before him. Then, because
they were magic glasses used only by the King, he could
see why she was beautiful.</p>
<p>In her mind he found clean thoughts; in her life he
found kind deeds; in her soul he found a high ideal; in
her heart he found a mother-love for little children.</p>
<p>Then the messenger took from his arm the scroll which
he carried and with his stylus he wrote these words:</p>
<p>&#8220;In all the world I find no more beautiful thing than a
maiden who is reaching toward life&#8217;s highest goal&mdash;a
noble womanhood&mdash;with love to show her the way.&#8221;</p>

<a name='THE_TREASURE' id='THE_TREASURE'></a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
<h2>THE TREASURE</h2>
</div>

<p>Four girls they were&mdash;four laughing girls from the
High School. For three happy years they had
studied together and played together. But now Ambition
had whispered to them. To each the message had been
the same:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hidden in the way that is ahead you will find a treasure.
It is of all treasures most valuable. It will bring
to you comfort and happiness all the days of your life.
Seek and ye shall find.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at once they began to wish to find the treasure.
Not to each other even did they tell the secret that Ambition
had whispered, for then another might find the
treasure. Each in her own way began to seek, and for a
time their paths still led in the same direction.</p>
<p>But one bright, beautiful day they came to a place
where the ways parted. Many roads led from the one
road and on every road there were many people. Now
what should be done? In which way was the treasure to
be found? If one chose the wrong way, one might never
find it.</p>
<p>There was little time to stand and think, for the crowds
pressed on behind, always urging them forward. Into
one they must go at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely this is the road,&#8221; said the first, looking down a
beautiful, long roadway. &#8220;One would certainly find something
worth while in such a beautiful place as this. Here
are lights and music; here are songs and merriment; here
are people who seem as happy as the day. I shall enter
here, and after I have danced and played with the brightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
dressed girls whom I see, I shall hunt diligently for the
treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she entered the way of Pleasure and, because there
was time for naught else but play, her days passed and
she found it not.</p>
<p>&#8220;That road does not appeal to me,&#8221; said the second.
&#8220;The red of the lights, the noise of the music, the laughter
of the people seem annoying to me. I do not care to go
with you longer. I like this yellow way. There must be
a great sun to light the way, for it is so beautiful. Here,
too, every one is searching, so I am sure they must have
knowledge that the treasure is here. I will enter and
find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she, too, entered the way of her choice and it was
the way of Gold. All about her were traces of treasure,
but there were many who pushed her aside. She grew
weary with her search; she liked little the people who were
her companions in the way, and she found there no treasure
that brought comfort and happiness all her days.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like little those long, uninteresting roadways where
it all is glitter and noise,&#8221; said the third. &#8220;I like little the
great crowds of people. I shall take this hilly road where
few are working. They seem eager to reach the top.
Now all treasure is hidden in the hillsides. I shall climb
here and search.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she entered the way of Fame. It was very steep; at
first it seemed that she could find no place to put even one
foot. She must cling to very uncertain bits along the way
to help her to move up, yet little by little she climbed. It
took years and years, and one by one her companions
dropped by the way. Those who also neared the top had
little of companionship for her. They envied her her footholds;
they tried to get ahead of her in the way. Then
she knew that she could never find the Great Treasure,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
for she was lonely, and a lonely heart is never satisfied
and happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which shall I choose?&#8221; said the fourth girl, looking
all about her. &#8220;I think I shall try this&#8221;&mdash;but just then a
voice said: &#8220;I am tired and ill. Will you help me a bit
in my way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas an old, old man. His clothes showed signs of
travel and his face was very sad. Taking his hand, she
led him for a time till he came to a resting place.</p>
<p>Then she was about to go back and choose her road, but
a child&#8217;s voice said: &#8220;Won&#8217;t you help me up this hill?
I fall back when I try to climb.&#8221; And she went still farther
into the way.</p>
<p>And then, when the child had been given over to his
mother, a boy needed help in carrying a load, and as she
talked with him she forgot the other road and began to see
the beautiful things ahead in the road over which she
was traveling.</p>
<p>There were flowers to pick and give to the sad; there
were cooling springs where one could find cups of water
for the weary; there were resting places under the trees
to which one could lead the aged. And she had forgotten
that she came to seek for a treasure for herself in her
happiness in helping others.</p>
<p>So the days passed, filled to the brim with loving, helping
deeds. The music which she heard was the song of
the birds; the beautiful colors to cheer came in the
flowers and in the sunset; the hills in the way were easily
climbed, for there was much of friendship as she toiled
upward.</p>
<p>One day in her path she saw a bent old lady in whose
one hand was a book and in whose other hand was a
basket. She seemed heavily loaded and the girl hastened
to help her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let me carry your basket,&#8221; she said cheerily. &#8220;Put
the book on the top and I can take them both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a smile came over the face of the woman as she
said: &#8220;The basket seems to be heavy, for in it is a great
treasure. But he that hath this treasure finds no difficulty
in carrying it. It is yours, child&mdash;all yours. Let
me read to you from the book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very slowly she opened the great book and read:
&#8220;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these, ye have done it unto me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the gray cloak fell aside and her raiment was
shining as the sun. Her beautiful face grew more beautiful
as she handed the basket to the girl, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the command of our King&mdash;to him that hath
shall be given and he shall have abundance! Take your
treasure&mdash;the love of the people along the way, but take
also the gift of the King&mdash;comfort and happiness all the
days of your life. For you entered the way of Love to
seek for your treasure and where Love is, there God is
also.&#8221;</p>
